Description
-----------

About a billon people have seen our planet on Google Maps - one pervasive view of the world.
JavaScript can make a plethora of beautiful, zany, quirky, custom maps, but there are two major barriers: the separate evolution of the geospatial/mapping community, and the time needed to make a map from scratch.

In this talk I'll cover some new techniques for making maps (using WebGL, vector tiles, and canvas) and how to empower both web developers and traditional mappers with one common language: JavaScript.

Main points:

- getting started with OpenStreetMap and other geodata
- making interesting visualizations without worrying about if they're practical
- documenting (and live-streaming?) everything
- setting up a platform (on a NodeJS server) to make custom maps available to non-programmers, too

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm a traveling web developer and mapmaker, currently making open source apps
with the Asia Foundation. In the past I've worked at the Museum of Modern Art,
Code for America, the City of Boston, and One Laptop per Child.

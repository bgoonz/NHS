Reactive Programming for Couch Potatoes
=======================================

* Speaker   : Andrew Hao
* Available : Any slot
* Length    : 35min

Description
-----------

You've heard the yapping about functional reactive programming and
how it's the bee's knees.  But... you can't figure out how it works,
and all the math-talk and theory jargon that comes up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) is confusing to you.

Fear not! Together, we'll go through the concepts of streams,
functions, and data flow. We'll break down the concepts into
easy-to-digest diagrams and explain them in plain English. We'll discuss
some powerful tools in our functional toolbelt and explore how to apply
them to common programming problems.

With this newfound knowledge, we'll build ourselves a pedometer (step
counter) with an HTML5 device accelerometer and RxJS (a Javascript FRP
library).

We'll make connections to how reactive principles are making their way
into frameworks like Redux, Cycle.js and Elm. To top it all off, we'll
then spend a little bit of time retrofitting our code to work in Cycle.js.

By the end of our time together, we'll have not only explored code built with
reactive tooling, we'll have learned the fundamental principles and insights
to implement reactive principles in projects to come!

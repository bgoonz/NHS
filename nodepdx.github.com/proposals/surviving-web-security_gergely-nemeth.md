Security - the elephant in the room. Everyone agrees that it is very important but few takes it seriously: in the recent past a huge number of companies leaked massive amounts of user data. Let's take a look how we can survive web security - from an application developer's point of view.

In this talk we are going to go through web security issues affecting Node.js applications and how to fix them. Some of these issues are among the OWASP Top 10 and pose serious risk for web applications.

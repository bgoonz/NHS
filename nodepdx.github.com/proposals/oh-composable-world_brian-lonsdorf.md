Description
-----------

Chaining with dot syntax is a lovely thing; wouldn’t it be great if we could just dot along, chaining null checks with async actions & loops with try/catch blocks etc? All those prickly syntax rules and untidy variables get in the way of our data flow.

This talk demonstrates practical every day usage of the Free monad. We avoid any maths or theory and just get to the usage. In addition to standard constructs, we’ll see how to create custom chainable actions, test interpreters, we’ll examine `for comprehensions`, and we’ll discover the parallels in architectures like redux/elm.

========================

Abstract
----------

How a JavaScript engine works? What are its basic components? How to measure its performance? What is JIT compilation? Stigmatization: is JavaScript fast enough? are some of the questions I think we currently fail to answer in a, somewhat, short and direct way.

Description
-----------

The most advanced JavaScript engines (V8, Chakra and SpiderMonkey) are now Open Source, setting the bar pretty high for the upcoming generation of engines along with the runtimes that are using them - Node.js, JXCore, etc - and challenges developers to try to understand a whole new group of concepts hidden in the execution of their JavaScript applications.
Crankshaft, unoptimized hell, LLVM and asm.js sound like names of main characters and places of a George R. R. Martin’s novel. I’ll talk about their definitions and why they should be important for developers.

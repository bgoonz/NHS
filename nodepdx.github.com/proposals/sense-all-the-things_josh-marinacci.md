Description
-----------

IoT solutions w/ programmability are great if you can always predict 100% what you want to do, and there is only one person in the house. And if all of your devices are made by the same company. And if they regularly update the firmware. That’s a lot of IFs. The real world is too messy for this top down approach to work. If we had build the web that way it would never have worked.

In this talk I propose a decentralized bottom up approach where all devices and sensors are peers; each responding, or not, to requests information from others. This proposal borrows the best ideas from the web to build a system that is flexible and degrades gracefully.

IoTReX: Developing a New Platform for Hardware with Observables
========================

Description
-----------

The world of Internet of Things is exploding, and node combined with johnny-five let us access that world with JavaScript - and anything included in the JavaScript ecosystem. In the web world, we've seen a recent comeback from RxJS, the reactive extensions that interpret all data as streams called observables. This happens to be perfect for reading data from microcontrollers and sensors. Using socket.io and RxJS, we can set up a platform to allow for real-time data reading, manipulation, and visualization from microcontrollers. In this talk, I will explain some of the basics of RxJS and observables, then walk through the setup of an Arduino with this platform. I'll also discuss some of the potential impacts of this platform on industry, agriculture, and social justice. Finally, as one of the many uses for this combination of tech is in music, I'll end by demonstrating an Arduino theremin that changes pitch based on the readings of light sensors.


Speaker Bio

I'm the lumberjack viking type who likes to hike and be outside, learn blacksmithing and woodworking, and play music when I'm not writing code for Energy Trust of Oregon here in Portland. I'm also an IoT enthusiast and am passionate about helping to discover its implications for industry, agriculture, and social justice - and empowering others to do the same.

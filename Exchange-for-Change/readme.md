# Exchange for Change

### Proposal for the City owned Proerty at 2496 Coolidge St. 

Working together to create an open, public schoolhouse where community members are free to teach, to learn, connect, and share.  A true community resource.

###  Programs and Classes

The goal of this space is to allow the community to determine what they need with regard to education, resources, and local activities.  As such, they will step up to be heard, and find ways to provide for each other.  Already, many people are committed to offering classes and activities that are missing from publicly available sources.  

Some activities and classes follow.  Note that these are not hypothetical, but that we have experienced community members ready and willing to offer these:

* computer programming and web development
* digital arts and literacy
* core education: Math and Reading
* languages, and cultural exchange
* health and wellness
* music, dance and performance 
* yoga, martial arts
* peer counceling 
* mutual child care

Most activities will be open to any and all, and some will be exclusively for childnren of certain age groups.  

Additionally, the space may provide many other important resources, such as printers, sewing machines, tool lending, and free WIFI.


### Governance

The community wishes for this center to be openly governed by consensus rather than a heirarchical committee.  We believe, and have experience to show, that a community space can be operated and managed, kept clean, safe and available for all... by making it available for all.  Leaders will lead, teachers teach, members will join.  A mutual stake for all people of all ages in such an important resource is enough to ensure the space and equipment are kept clean, safe and orderly.

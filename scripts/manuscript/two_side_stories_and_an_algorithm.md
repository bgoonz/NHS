Two Stories + An Algorithm (what's the algorithm?)

The cyberwizard in the far Future who uses old speculative fiction like a witch uses spellbooks
&
The Modest Megalomaniac

First, The Latter

A computer scientist among computer scientists.
Working on the Infinite Project.
They would have called it the GOD Project or simply GOD
but there were some exceptions which bubbled all the way
to the brass-dioxylate bureaucracy
the memo said
	The problem is as we see it
	that this isn't a creation of God
	this one belongs to Man

Which is proof that the system is fallible‚Äî
undesirable, still, at that time,
before fallibility became a feature.
In the 24rd century.
And that they should not undertake it:
It's logical blasphemy, and the system can't take it!

But the irony stops here,
said the middle upper level Devil.
Memo intercepted
propagation ceased immediately
Memo never made it up the DEO
Back down the shaft chuted many tiny devils, with a Memo.
The new memo said,
  If we prove this one
  Then we disprove them all!
  If we disprove the one
  We prove mankind inadequate.
  And it's in your contract.
  
Indeed, the project seemed implausible to Henry.
The younger Artificial Engineers were enamored of all the possibilities,
living in relatively-recent-history deprivation and unable contextualize reality.
As was Henry, until he'd lived through 80 years of it.
Henry knows what a fantasy state it is to be in.
He recognizes it like for like, yet without recollection.
He read on flibbertipedia that the only way to enter
the singular world of a fantast is by the perversion of
normative biochemical signal processing, for instance,
a thumb in the anus. There are many others. Books.
Still then the only treatment is to pull them out somehow.
Without getting sucked over.
  Would you like to read about the time a guy went off and did that?
  Later, Henry meets a woman [Foggy Pellucidity] who also quit the paradigm and perverted some fantasts
    she tells a tale

Henry, nor anybody, knew much of precedent,
circumstances, curvilineage, pre-time.
Only enough to get them into the continuation.
Which is merely education.
Here is what Henry knew, in points of fact:
  1. The Infinite Project was started before he was born
  2. That his own memory could not retain without corruption,
     and he couldn't wipe it clean either.
     
Henry tried to remember as little as possible.
What are all the things he stored in database?
Scrupulously has he moved every triviality and novelty he encountered to the crowd
He didn't even keep indexes on any of it, therefor,
for instance, asked when his mother's birthday is
he might remember the data eventually, repeatedly, or never,
and tho completely lacking in means to verify, 
He could trust it was inaccurate, and possibly unrelated
since nobody else in the world had regard for the date of that occasion, either.

HAd Henry found serenity?
mostly what he does is interpret commands from his inbox
and then compose a completely arbitrary module
which converts one of THE MONSTERS queries into, say,
metric tensility, b/c the M doesn't want to waste its 
budding omnideation on trivialities
when it can be computed by the crowd.
WHen Henry read the requisition, 
he sent a requisition to The M
"What is the probability that you ever seek to know a conversion to metric tensility?"
While awaiting the response, he imagined that the M
had superior units and measurements to serve what higher functions


The scientist programs a replacement for himself, of himself
so that he wont have to be replaced
recognizing that by then he was fairly whittled into his several various modes
of thought
of action
of reasoning
which now never changed
and could be used to get a few things right
to solve a few problems
He knows what works for him
It turns out his idiosyncrasies were the fizzled end of some processies
And that the more of his own idiosyncrasies he could find
the better he could outline and define his simulacrum 

‚ÄúMy human algorithms,‚Äù he called it, ‚ÄúThe Best of‚Äù

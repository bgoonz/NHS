Hey you guys. This isn't funny.
Riffing on Davie like that.
Davie is not a criminal. Davie is not a sociopath.
Davie just has a tubular focus depth of field problem.
Only a few tubes, too. They are like plugs.
Everything comes in and out of them.
And into Davies belly.

Davie cannot sense certain things,
because other hot white lights
scorch his tubes.

This causes Davie to place blame
and to and take renegade
vengence aginst objects that bear no
resemblance or relativity to
the three things Davie hates.

Davie is taking medication.
But it is experimental.
Davie takes daily three yellow and green test 
Tubular Focus Depth of Field
synapse wideners.

But it leave Davie bored and unnerr-err-errr-errr

mummmmmm...

Sorry, a girl women just walked by the window, across the street.
She was checking her mail.

She looked at Davieâ€™s house, but Davie know she can't see me
because He went out there once and looked back.
It's just a reflection of the sun and sky, is all one see.

The things being said about Davie, here and elsewhere
Are seen as things that Davie feels
that Davie is allowed to feel in that stomach bottoming way.
This is called intuition, have you ever heard of it?

You know when your favorite actor hears sad rejection music
while looking at the biggest most beautiful face
even as it scorns him shamefully?

That's how these sayings make Davie feel.

Davie is not perfect, and also Davie knows it.
That is also the reasoning for Davie's one bad thing
that I do, which is sneaking all of the cookies.

Mother said it's a blessing and a curse that I don't have a memory for stomach aches.

Davie has extraordinary memory for some things.
He used to,
anyway.

Then, Davie had extraordinary memory for some things.
He used to,
anyway.

Before Davie began therapy and experimental medications
Davie tried generic speed.
Davie admits, it was a blessing and a curse.
Davie could easily understand complex schema.
Like the Magnetic Kinked Hyrdo Propulsion Device.
And Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
And What Davie did when he found Oscar stuck in a hump with
his neighbor Penny, Davie was extremely quickly able
to reason was a just execution.
Oscar always Chased Davie after school.
It was the most terrifying thing.
Because it seemed as if Oscar could run as far as he wanted and he was much faster than Davie but then Oscar would stop and until Davie was out of sight he would just bark and bark.

Davie knows his yellow and green pills
are to help him to be numb. That way,
the neighbors mailbox will not bother Davie.

Davie is now much more serene and bored.
But he remembers the things that he hates most.
He is thinking that he may be able to add a fourth,
a fourth thing to hate. Which is all the sayings.
All the sayings about Davie, here, in this forum.

Maybe a fifth thing as well.
What if Davie hates yellow and green?
Think about it.

Point Nine Repeated
 ______________  
.99999999999999 = One

I hold that this is true, because I was convinced, 1 time.

Not because I know the proof.

I would have to reference the Internet to suit your incredulity.

Unless you already knew.
 

.9 = One

Believe me or not, there is no argue.  

Because I was convinced, twice one time!

What I want to know is: Why can't I imagine why?


I can prove that I don't intuitively understand, if needed:

For if I did, then there would have to be

something special about point n repeated,

Where n is only limited by my imagination.


So, then, why can't I imagine the fact that is true?

Because it never burned my skin?

Because it never poked me in the eye?


Look, I can imagine all of those nines!

I can imagine a conga line of nines!

One after the next, fore to tail, 

dancing in one infinite loop.


And scattered about the barn

here and there

one nine, plus one n of nines, 

where n makes it a group.


A few more nines keep time

one with a banjo

one whistling, 

one stomping boot

one with, what is that, a pipe or a flute?

one with one tooth.


That one in the corner is actually two, 

One of whom is roughing it's suit.


Some ones mirror loved ones, in the photo booth.


All of sudden one nine hollars, "Hey all you decimals, point to your right."

Which would be left to us.


Well, scratch my imagination. 

Poof goes the proof. 

And all are one.

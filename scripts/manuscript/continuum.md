It is good to be uneducated in these times.
Much needs must be forgotten.
Stuff written and lawed, again rewritten and corroborated
But perhaps wrong and certainly flawed.
Buoyed by the fact of discovery --- the things discoved and the cycle of discovery itself, in science and thought and ideas and always transcendence.
The basis and foundation of modern everything
Thought, self-reference, place in time, relation to world,
reality perception, psychology, humanity, individuality.

Worded or otherwise symbollic rationality
made to order
and re-order 
all the atoms of the external world
so that they mean something for or about the thinker
but meaningless to him
“for” and “about” are reassuring and auto-promoting
“to” to be dodged, or unacknowledged, meaningfully
Unless it bodes sensual gratification
or a chain of social reactions that lead thereto
such as moneyed exchanges (profit, spending)

For what good is the rational, except in mathematical terms?
A ratio is useful is relating
But to rationalize alone, or between the mirror-planes of external and self
which is more alone
Is the ratio of a thing to itself
a constant relative
which nature abhors as inbred
and the machine as neverendingly, infinitely cyclical
This is to self as self is to itself greater than or less than this is to itself
Do not self-medicate with rationality
And perhaps not at all through language
You see how easy it was to write rational nonsense?
The words and writing and language direct the conscious 
and so too the maintanance state, the sub-conscious neuromatics
Same as how we may unconsciously perform a physical task
from muscle memory
The rational trains the automatic mind easily
if it can do so to the arbitrary one.
Perhaps this explains why dreams we know to be completely non-real
can be so forcefully compelling as to become extensional, 
nominated and explicated into reality world.
Whence the soundless voice of thought?
Is the simply the echo of the familiar which is the lingual?
But I think in pictures equally, yet those are imaginings, fabrications, compsoitions
and the soundless voice of thought is at least atomically a formally structured thing.
Imagination creates from no necessary stock 
but may be formless beyond comprehension
The soundless voice must be made of known pieces
but may write any infinity of meanings or comprehensive nonsense

If musical ratios were the blocks of thought.
If the codification of auditory language was harmonic, rhymthic, tembric, etc
(What of the written?)
instead of lingual and phonetic and etymologically arbitrarily or incomplete
would statements that are true, and positive constructions
be the only ones which made pleasing sense?
Could we be assured of recogniznig the “wrong” or dangerous thoughts or ideas
by their dissonance, cacophony, metric imbalance, in the ear, and in the soundless
music of thought?
Yet music can be the trickest, see the piper
Would not work at keeping the harmonious extensible exclusively to the harmonious good
But perhaps could leaven all plus and minus
so that none were elevated on accident, and none were reproached from bias
but that all required meditation. 
This needs further research, into the logical constructs or music to our brain.
Maybe education aint so bad.

I Feel Like This Could Go On Forever 

 I got a new job. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
When? 
Last week. 
You did? 
I did. 
What do you do? 
I show derivative line pictures to a machine. 
High tech career! 
The machine guesses what item the derivative line picture is stamped on. 
Charades! 
It’s really hard to beat the machine, but if you do, for some reason you get the thing with the derivative line picture on it for free. Unless it’s alcohol, tobacco or a firearm. 
A game show, and you’re the host! 
Do you now the statistics on how long a show will last when it produces a loser to winner ratio this bad? 
No. 
I bet somebody does. 
Lotta losers? 
Practically everyone. 
The price is always right. Or never is, I mean. 
I’m not the host either. 
What are you? 
I’m higher-up in the social order of things. 
Than the host? 
Yeah. 
You’re not the pretty lady! 
… 
Are you the producer? 
No, that guy stacks vegetables compared to what I do. 
The writer? 
Nope, the machine does all the reading and writing. I don’t even half to know how. 
What are you then? 
I’m an Associate. 
A Facilitator? 
An Intermediary. 
An Interloper! 
No, that’s my boss! 
Ahhhh-ha-ha! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

What would you rather be, a human body, a human no-body, an inhuman no-body? Corpus Homo, Homo Incorporate., Homeless Inc.? 
Does the human body feels pain? 
Yes, but it dreams, too. 
But it feels pain? 
That too, that too. 
It dreams and it feels pain. 
It also remembers and forgets, but only when it is rather humorous and useless. 
The human no-body feels no pain. 
No. 
Does it dream? 
No, but it thinks “forwardly”, if that’s any consolation. 
Does it remember or forget? 
Only when it is profitable or loss-mitigating. 
Nice. And it cannot be jailed? 
Nor dies. A feature it shares with the likes of inhuman no-bodies. 
Those also feels no pain? 
No. Nor forgets, ever. Needs vindication like aspirin, though.  
What a life. 
Actually its dead.
Can that feature be toggled?
No.
I think I’ll go with the human no-body. 
Your future holds excellent tax benefits. 
Oh wo-ow! 
And you know what else? 
What? 
YOU’RE THE NEXT CONTESTANT ON OUR NEW PREMIUM-TIME GAMESHOW: WHAT AM I ANYMORE, EVEN! 
What can I win? 
An incredible shock to your social spheres, child’s upbringing, family sense of fulfillment, estrangement, et cetera et cetera! 
OH MY GOD 
Heeeeeeeeeeere’s your interloper--
Your first question: 
Hush 
A riddle! 
Oooo 
How do you know where your neighbor’s bathroom is, without ever having used it? You get three questions. 
Okay. 
What does my neighbor look like? 
You! 
What does my neighbor smell like? 
Coffee! 
Is my neighbor… me? 
Going with the audience’s response. No.
So how do you know where your neighbor’s bathroom is, without ever having used it? 
Is it… in the same place relative to floor plan as mine? 
… 
… 
… 
Floor plans you can trust…
You Got It Right!
Woo! I could find it blindfolded, or drunk.
Okay. Question Number Two. 
Hush 
Ding bonk 
What were you doing on the day after Thanksgiving, in the year two-thousand-and-three? 
Day after thanksgiving, you say? 
Hmmm. 
That would be a what, a Friday. Obviously. 
Oh! I woke up in a hospital. 
That time of year. 
Thanksgiving. 
To give thanks. 
And to give a little somethin’ back, too, you know? In exchange for extra values. 
Speaking of extra values, lets break for a moment to talk about your family. 
Sure. 
You inject your children with values, correct? 
Yes. Absolutely. 
Applause 
Absolute values? 
Extra values. 
Extra values? 
Definitely. They have more than their peers, it’s obvious just by looking. 
Applause 
Applause 
Ho ho, well I’m sure the competition is close. 
Applause

If evolution was so damn good and smart and efficacious then why do we have legs instead of wheels? And why aren’t we made on assembly lines? Think of the labor jokes! 
Because God endowed us instead with those abilities. 
The ability to roll? 
No. Well sort of. As children, where hills are available. 
The ability to be conveyed? 
Sort of. 
I mean he gave us the means to find means to roll and to assemble and to assemble people to assemble. 
Thank God. 
Agreed. 
Hallelujah. 
Also agreed. 
What values! 
What values, you ask? 
He had a plan. 
Heaven on Earth.  
What’s your most extreme? 
Our Extremests are made to order. 
They shouldn’t be made to do that. 
Order is good. One thing after another. Could go on forever.

Psst. Come ere. You need help. Don’t you? I can help. I have what you need. I have what you’re looking for. I mean it. How do I know? I just do. It’s my business to know what you want. Might say it’s my business to make what you want. I mean construct it. I mean design it. I mean create it. I create what you want. I create your want. Then I make it. A ton of it, too. Because it’s what you want and what you need. I made sure. I make sure. You might say making sure is my business. You might say making certainties is what I do. Don’t worry. It’s somewhere between all natural and god free. Eh? I told you: I’m good at what I do. It’s my business to be good. At what I do, I mean. Ha-ha. 


So you in? You in? That’s right. Oh you wanna know what it is that I got? That I got, and that you need? Okay. You need to escape? You need to dream? You need to have a foundation? Built for you? You need a way to go from your foundation to your escape? And back? In style or comfort? Or Both? To your dream, in a dream, like a dream? You wanna float to work! You wanna gravitate there? You wanna just materialize there? 
Yeah! You don’t wanna be here now, you be there now, and be here later. Or not at all. 
If it’s avoidable. You wanna escape without moving? Tricky, but I can do it. If you gimme your ears. Hey, you wanna deal? On bellicosity and rapprochement? Wanna customize it? Make it custom. Make it customary? You can do that. You can start your own unique tradition, you can. You can choose up to five ways to customize it, then compare it against others, through our network, against someone somewhere else, far away, so they can’t touch you, and see whose is best. 


Except. You know. Times is tough. Not everybody quantifies. But we can work with you. We have levels. Steps. Echelons. Don’t worry, they all look and sound the same. Nobody will know. But—how do I broach this? I gotta know. I just gotta. I gotta know where you stand, like on a scale. What I’m saying is, you gotta have the score to score, you know? That’s the score. What’s your score? I don’t wanna get all up in your business, but I can’t trust ya unless you believe me. So I gotta know how good your credulity is, is it average, above average, below average? Good credulity, bad credulity, no credulity? No I won’t believe that, that’s unpossible, everybody these days got some credulity. Most people got terrible good credulity. But it’s okaaaaaay if yours ain’t up, we can help, naw-mean? We want everybody to have a chance, we want everybody to build up good credulity, it’s healthy, you can do it, you can have it, just gotta believe, just come with me, gimme your name, your address, and gimme your social security, we’ll check ya out, consolidate your doubts, put some new tires on ya, spit polish ya, wax your face, chest, nails, ya ass, make ya look gooooood. 


Come on man. All ya gotta do is be-lieve!

What I want Is The Robotic Slipper That Perambulates for Me. And plugs itself back in when I get tired And I would like The Automatic Insta-Documenter. It automatically and insta-lly documents every little lepton in this gigantic jiveass jigsaw puzzle. To make sure that not-a-one is funnin’ around on me, or with us. It then takes this documentation, see, and permanent-ifies it as a de facto part of the Documenter, sort of a surrogate existence, a barnacle of reality, so that say if somebody else wants to know the down-low on some trifle atom, some trifling little atom, they can make citation and reassure themselves and everybody else, particularly, that what they thought was or was not The Instance—The one that did or did not have very little consequence, but now soon will, despite itself—They can say to themselves about It All: 


See! 
Or: I told you so! 
Or: Didn’t I? 
Oh: I didn’t? 
I thought I did. 
I can’t believe it, I didn’t tell you! 
I thought I told everybody? 
How did I not tell you!
How did I not? 
How? How did I not!
How am I gonna not? 
Well here it is. 
See! Look. Oh, and see.


And the Automatic Insta-Documentationalist is like: 


It’s right here. Proof. That this or that existed, here, in just the way previously assured, to others, if not you, but the fact of the matter is a matter of fact and is not a matter of opinion. 


The Automatic Insta-documentationalist goes on (and on): 


The truth. There it is, at that moment, at that very moment, and only at that very moment, and maybe, perhaps, not at any other moment? Perhaps never again being so, being the truth, you know, who knows? It doesn’t matter, because at the moment when it was true, or in other words, at it’s moment of inception, at its conception, one and the same for truths and big bangs, temporally speaking— 


ENTER TIME: 
TIME: WHEN I SPEAK YOU WILL KNOW IT, PLEASE. THANKS. 
IGNORE TIME, FOR NOW. 


—It was obviously true, or else how could I show it to you now, thusly documented? That’s the beauty of Automatic Insta-Documentation, do you get it? Don’t you see? 
As for things that are now no longer true, I refute that there was a time when it was true. Like innocence. Look how cute it was.


For it, whatever it is (it doesn’t matter what it is—does it?—or else why would it exist?) was immediately annexed by the truth, like life to a baby, by virtue of, or, unlike a baby, the iniquity of its very existence. 

Before the advent of The Automatic Insta-Documenter, it might very well not have been the case, it might not have had a case, unless sit came in one, because, whatever the case: I would have forgotten it, like a fleeting thought that did not warrant careful examination, let alone realization, vocalization or dramatization because (some of many possible reasons) I was drunk, or I was on the train, or I was biting my nails with my auto-manicure-all. 

And so while it might have existed in abject brevity, there could be no proof. Thank god that’s not the case anymore. God, can you imagine what it must have been like? Humanity is making strides. This is the true age of enlightenment, the age of light, the Thomas Kincaid of ages. 


The Automatic Insta-Documentationalist could go on, could prevail: 


But now, to continue, in case I haven’t made my point, the truth obtains, the truth persuades, even. See! Look! The Automatic Insta-Documenter has exterminated those fleeting thoughts I was talking about, the one’s that did not require careful examination. They are fleeting no more! 


Now please respond so I know that you know, that I may be comfortable, at least for a moment, irrefutable now (or will be once I press…), that we are all living together in the exquisite refulgence of documentation. 
… 
And while they descend into what The Informationalists call ”critical dialogue about user-created content”, we fade away, we fade away, we fade away, closing on them the curtain of courtesy, causing such side effects as sharp pain in the ambivalence.

## THE BLOB
______

It is 2:31 in the morning.

A public gathering on the outskirts of a government compound.

Citizens assembled.

Scientists, reporters, pagans.

Families, strangers.

Standing along a perimeter fence, or hovering back near the dirt lot, or over by the trees, picnic tables and grass.

Two signs on the perimeter fence.

One says “Public Viewing Area”

The other says “Use of deadly force authorized”

Many family members are wrapped in blankets.

Some brought their dogs. 

The nearest city, 40 miles east-slightly-north is called Crawdad and has a population of 46,000 and is where the hotels are at.

Half a mile deep into the interior of the fenced perimeter, a compound is glowing; it has curved walls and frosted glass, barbed wires, runway lights strung along concentric, concrete paths, and several checkpoints. 

The crowd of people are awaiting the awakening of the "singularity".

Allegedly, the Blob is intelligent enough to understand human limitations, and problems, and solve them, instantly;  few asked whether such an intelligent being think it wise to do that.

Upon awakening of it's birth, the Blob performs a scan, and reports that there is no way to save mankind from this fate.

The crowd is disappointed; few think the Blob is lying, but most consider this blob to be yet another idiot.

They turn to each other and shrug it off. 

Some hang around to picnic and watch the military shoot off missiles.  

The blob believes it would be a shame to let mankind go extinct; It commits to starting a human zoo, on the moon.

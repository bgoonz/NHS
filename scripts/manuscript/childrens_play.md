MOM: (From offstage. Almost sing-songy, as mothers can be) Albert! Lisa! Don’t forget to take you vitamins! 

KIDS: Yes mom!

MOM: And make sure you eat some toast!

KIDS: OK, mom!

MOM: And each of you drink a glass of orange juice!

KIDS: We know mom!

MOM: And you have to finish the box of Yuck-O’s cereal before you can open the box of Fudge Kispers! 

KIDS: WE KNOW MOM!

MOM: OK, kids… And Kids?

KIDS: What mom?

MOM: Don’t take too long, (KIDS mock MOM by saying the following words with her) you have to be to school in an hour!

(The kids sit at the table, not wanting to eat the Yuck-O’s. LISA has a bowl that had gone soggy that she is playing with, but not eating. ALBERT is eyeing the box of Fudge Krispers intently. He reaches for the box.)

LISA: (Smacking his hand) You heard mom, you can’t have those!

ALBERT: But it has a toy in it! A character from the Medieval Dwellers League, my favorite comic!

LISA: Well, you just have to wait. 

ALBERT: You can wait all you want, I am going to open the box. I hate Yuck-O’s anyway. (He grabs the box)

LISA: Albert, you are going to get us in trouble!

ALBERT: I’ve got an idea. Why don’t you eat all the Yuck-O’s? Then I can have the Fudge Krispers. 

LISA: That’s not fair! I don’t like Yuck-O’s either! 

ALBERT: I can’t get the box open. 

LISA: Good! Serves you right. 

ALBERT: Come on, help me (He has gotten up for better leverage)

LISA: No, I don’t want to get in trouble.

ALBERT: (Crossing around the table and dangling the box infront of LISA) Mmm! But they are sooooo gooooood! You know you want some. You don’t want me to have it all to myself do you? (LISA tries to grab it, ALBERT pulls it back. He backs up into a more open space in the kitchen, away from the table). Come get it Lisa!

LISA: (Waits a moment before flying over to her brother and grabbing the box) Give them to me, Albert. I’ll open them!

ALBERT: No way, you’ll keep them for yourself! (There is a tug-o-war going on)

LISA: No, I just want to open them! (She tugs them away and turns her back tying to open them) I can’t open them. It’s like it is glued shut! 

ALBERT: I told you, now give it back!

LISA: Here, hold onto it while I try to open it. 

ALBERT: No, you hold onto it while I try to open it. 

(They tug and pull and finally the box rips open, spilling cereal on the floor. A small figurine lies in the middle somewhere)

LISA: Oh no! We are going to be in huge trouble!

ALBERT: Hey! It’s the Greedy Gargoyle action figure! 

LISA: Ok, Albert, you go get a broom, I’ll start cleaning this mess up. Hey! You don’t get the toy!

ALBERT: It’s mine!

LISA: No Albert! I get it! I opened the box!

(They are both about to grab it)

MOM: (Still offstage) Kids, hurry up now! And brush your teeth afterwards!

KIDS: (Frozen) Y-yes mother!
 
(They both grab the toy at the same time. “It’s mine.” “No, it’s mine.”… There is a loud noise, a boom, perhaps, maybe some loud deep laughter. The lights go very bright and then to complete darkness, maybe some smoke. Lights go to normal—or maybe a shade of red covers everything— and the KIDS, each on their knees, have their hands on the legs of the Greedy Gargoyle Rubshubshub, who is full grown and real.)

RUB: Don’t forget to brush your teeth kids. 

KIDS: Y-yes… Uh…

RUB: I am Rubshubshub!

LISA: The Gargoyle? 

RUB: Yes.

ALBERT: Th-the Greedy Gargoyle? 

RUB. Well, that is not my name, but that is what some call me. You two can call me Master from now on, though (laughs). Come on out, Gargles!

LISA: Gargles? Doesn’t he mean gargoyles?

ALBERT: No. Gargles are like gargoyles when they are not full-grown!

(Two more gargoyles come out of the pantry closet, which is, perhaps, emanating light. They are not quite as magnificent as RUB)

RUB: Introduce yourselves, my little Gargles! 

FLANN: I am Flann-Flann Ramshackle Rebidious. (LISA giggles at the name. FLANN crosses to her and hisses) What are you laughing at little girl?!

LISA: N-nothing.

PETE: Uh, Ah’m Pete!

ALBERT: (Laughing) You’re the dumb one! 

RUB: Silence, you! Both of you! You can kiss your happy world goodbye. Pretty soon, you will wish you were at home stuffing yourself with Yuck-O’s (RUB grabs a hand full of Yuck-O’s and shoves them in his mouth. All gargoyles laugh). Grab them, my little Gargles! 

(FLANN and PETE each grab the one of the KIDS)

LISA: (Struggling) Wait, where are you taking us?!

ALBERT: Yeah, we have school!

RUB: You need not worry about school ever again! (Gargoyles laugh).

MOM: (Still offstage) Kids?

(Silence onstage. The gargoyles glower and growl and hiss at the KIDS.)

KIDS: Y-yes Mom?

MOM: Are you ready yet?

(The next two pairs of lines are said together)

LISA: In a minute!

ALBERT: Yes, mother!

LISA: I mean, yes! 

ALBERT: In a minute. 

MOM: OK, I’ll be down in a just a second.

RUB: Ok my little gargles, take them back to the Stoney Forest. 

(Gargles cover KIDS mouths and exit through the pantry closet followed by RUB. Lights go to normal if they were changed. Mom enters.)

MOM: LISA! ALBERT! What is going on? Get down here and clean up this mess! Albert?! Lisa?! Get down here! You are both in serious trouble! I told you not to open the box of Fudge Krispers! Don’t make me come up there and get you! 

(MOM exits. PETE Re-enters through pantry. Lights change only if they changed before. PETE crosses to box of Yuck-O’s. Picks up box and also grabs a hand full. MOM re-enters, lights go back to normal again. PETE freezes.)

MOM: (Worried. Hasn’t yet noticed PETE) KIDS?! ALBERT?! LISA?! Where are you? This is not funny kids, don’t worry your mother like—(Notices PETE, who is trying to sneak back to the cupboard furtively. They both freeze.) What… who… you? 

PETE: (Not sure if he can scare her, he tries hissing, but his mouth is full of cereal. He is as frightened as MOM. Waves hello.) Pete…

MOM: P-Pete, is it? Do you know where my children are? (PETE shakes head. MOM takes step toward PETE. PETE takes step toward pantry.) P-Pete… all I want to know is where my children are. (Each takes another step) Come on Pete… (Pete throws box of Yuck-O’s at MOM and makes for the Pantry. When he opens it, the lighting changes. PETE walks in and closes the door behind him. Lights to normal. MOM recovers from cereal box and slowly approaches the pantry. She opens it and jumps back at the same time, but it is empty. She walks closer to it and peeps inside. Nothing. She places a foot inside and the lights change. She freezes, then takes her foot out and lights go to normal. Repeats a few times. She finally steps in and closes door behind her. She screams. Lights fade.)

(If a scene change is possible, everything in the erstwhile kitchen/dining area is changed to a fantastical forest with a path or two leading out somewhere. Pantry stays. If scene change is not an option, during the blackout everything in the kitchen is thrown into disarray and the lights should permanently change as if in a parallel realm. Maybe some black lighting and some sort of glow paint that can’t be seen with normal lights on (e.g. some liquid laundry detergents work well for this). Whatever the case, the new scene has MOM standing confronted with some odd looking Sprites. The Sprits are friendly, but she doesn’t know this yet so she screams the same scream that ended the previous scene. The sprites look to each other and see this as some sort of introduction, like an alien form of handshake, and scream themselves. All stand frozen for a moment before MOM starts moving very slowly, checking out these strange creatures. The Sprites mirror her movements. The Sprite’s names are Puck and Wiggy.)

PUCK: Hi! 

MOM:…

WIGGY: Hi! 

MOM: Hi. 

PUCK/WIGGY: Hi!

MOM: What… are you doing in my kitchen pantry? 

PUCK: We are not in your kitchen pantry.

WIGGY: You are in our forest. 

MOM: O…kay. What is your forest doing in my kitchen pantry?

PUCK: (Pointing to pantry) What is your kitchen pantry—

WIGGY: —Doing in our forest?

MOM: Who are you?

PUCK: He’s Wiggy.

WIGGY: She’s Puck. 

PUCK: Did you bring Yuck-O’s?

WIGGY: Yuck-O’s?! 

(PUCK and WIGGY, elated, begin dancing around MOM chanting “Yuck-O’s!” This frightens MOM)

MOM: I don’t have any Yuck-O’s for you. Stop! Stop! I don’t have anything! 

BOWDIE: (From Offstage) Puck! Wiggy! Let her be! Calm down now, leave her alone! (Enters. He is an Elf and he has PETE on a leash.) Or I’ll sick my new pet on you! (Sprites are afraid of PETE, and all gargoyles, for that matter. They hide behind MOM, screaming a high pitched, funny sounding scream.)

MOM:  (To PETE) You! (PETE hisses.)
BOWDIE: Me?
MOM: No.
BOWDIE: Them?
PUCK: (To WIGGY) You?
WIGGY: (To PUCK) You? 
PUCK/WIGGY: Me? Us? 
MOM: No!
(Silence)
PETE: Uh… me?
MOM: Yes!
BOWDIE: Oh, you know little Petey, do you? I just caught him coming out of the Forbidden Pantry. 
MOM: He was in my kitchen! He knows where my children are!
BOWDIE: He does, does he? I should have figured they were up to no good. 
MOM: Who? 
BOWDIE: Why, the gargoyles, of course. 
MOM: The gargoyles? Gargoyles don’t exist! 
BOWDIE: And neither do Sprites and Elves? Well, in that case, Humans do not exist either! How about that? Let me tell you something. We all exist, but we cannot exist together because you Humans are too stubborn to believe it! That is why we live here, and you live there (Indicating pantry).
MOM: So… who are you then?
BOWDIE: I am Old Bowdie. 
MOM: Old?
BOWDIE: Yes. 
MOM: But you look…
BOWDIEL: Yes, I know. I look young. But I am 150 years old. Now listen, enough with the gibber-jabber. It seams that we have a huge problem on our hands.
MOM: What do you mean?
BOWDIE: The gargoyles are trying to break the Sacred Law. 
MOM: What is the Sacred Law? 
PUCK/WIGGY: 
CRISS-CROSS, CROSS-CRISS
OUR TWO WORLDS SHALL NEVER MIX
YOU LIVE THERE AND WE LIVE HERE
AND EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPIER
CROSS-CRISS, CRISS-CROSS
THIS SHALL BE THE SACRED LAW
NOT TO BE BROKEN FOR IF YOU DO
UPON BOTH WORLDS BEFALL WILL DOOM!
BOWDIE: Thus, our two worlds can never co-exist. It would be tragic to both humans and us. It has been this way for thousands of years!
MOM: But what about this Sacred Law? Why don’t any humans know about it?
BOWDIE: Only a handful of humans were trusted with the secret when the pact was made some three thousand years ago. (BOWDIE goes into some type of story telling reverie while PUCK and WIGGY act out the motions) Yes, yes, it was three thousand years ago when there was almost a terrible war between Humans and Gargoyles. The Elves stepped in to stop the war. A great Elf named Que-Tarr met with a human leader named Rashma and together they devised a plan. The Elves would be responsible for keeping the Gargoyles from entering the Human realm, and the Humans would stay out of our realm. The pact was signed with gold ink and was never to be broken.
MOM: How did we—I mean the Humans—keep everybody from knowing about your world? 
BOWDIE: Ah yes, give much credit to your ancestors, for they were indeed brilliant. Knowing that that, by nature, the Humans race is a gullible one and that your imaginations run wild, the leaders turned our real world into a make believe world. 
MOM: I don’t understand.
BOWDIE: They turned us into fairy tails! They wrote fantastic stories about Elves ad Dwarves and Pixies and Gargoyles and everything else. They pretended that we were just figments of the Human imagination! Indeed, I have read some of these ‘fairy tails’ and they are quite good! 
(Sound offstage of a Dragon roaring. PETE, who has been asleep wakes up with a start.)
MOM: What was that?
BOWDIE: That sounds like Pyra.
MOM: Who or what is Pyra?
BOWDIE: Pyra is a Dragon, of course!
MOM: You have Dragons, too?
BOWDIE: Yes, but do not be frightened. Unlike in your stories of knights and Princesses and dragons, dragons are very peaceful creatures. (Dragon roars again) And very loyal, too. It sounds like Pyra is trying to signal that somebody is approaching, and I fear that it must be Rubshubshub.
MOM: Who is rub-a-dub-dub?
BOWDIE: Rubshubshub is a tyrant Gargoyle. He is Pete here’s master. He is evil. And if I am not mistaken, he probably has your children somewhere. 
MOM: But wait, gargoyles turn to stone during the day, don’t they? (PUCK and WIGGY laugh)
BOWDIE: Oh heavens no. That was yet another crafty trick your ancestors used in fairy tails. Gargoyles do turn to stone all right, but not because of daylight. You must tickle them on the back between their wings to turn them into stone, and I am afraid they don’t like that very much. 
MOM: Being tickled? 
BOWDIE: Being turned to stone! They hate it because when they are frozen in one position, it is impossible or them to scratch themselves when they have an itch. (PETE is scratching himself and then freezes as everyone looks at him) Here, let me show you what I mean. (BOWDIE approaches PETE who turns his back away from him while pleading not to be turned to stone. PUCK and WIGGY run up and tickle him between his wings. He laughs hysterically for moment before freezing his position. WIGGY and PUCK begin celebrating, dancing around, poking, laughing and sticking their tongue out at PETE ) HA! There, see! 
MOM: Will he be frozen forever?
BOWDIE: Unfortunately, no. He will remain frozen for about a day or until somebody tickles him again. Now, if you turn a Gargoyle to stone in your world, they will stay frozen until somebody unfreezes them. (He tickles PETE. PETE awakens laughing and then snaps at the SPRITES who bounce away in fright. He gives a displeased look toward BOWDIE.) That is what you get, Pete. You’re lucky I didn’t leave you petrified longer! For the most part, the Gargoyles are not very threatening. Pete here is harmless. But Rubshubshub is just plain evil. 
MOM: Well, what do I need to do to get my children back? That’s all I’m worried about!
BOWDIE: Well, we’ll get them back, alright, but we have much more to worry about if Rubshubshub is afoot and up to no good. 
PETE: Hey boss! (Giving away RUB’s position)
RUB: Pete, you imbecile, this (making a shh sign with his lips and finger) means be quiet no matter what world you’re from! 
BOWIE: What are you doing Rub? This forest is off limits to gargoyles! 
RUB: I merely came to get my little Pete. He wandered off while I was sleeping. Come on Pete, let’s go home. (PETE begins walking over to RUB nonchalantly, but BOWDIE pulls the leash)
BOWDIE: Not so quick, Rubshubshub, perhaps you have something—or someone—to trade in return for Pete?
RUB? What? What are you talking about? Give me Pete right now!
MOM: Where’s Lisa and Albert? Where are my children?
RUB: Who are they? Who are you? Bowdie, you scurvy old Elf, you know humans aren’t allowed in our world. What are you up to?
BOWDIE: Just whom are you trying to fool? Even Pyra knows you are up to mischief. (Hear dragon’s roar. It startles RUB and PETE) Now look here, Rubshubshub, let us cut right to it.
RUB: Fine, it’s no secret, I have the human children, those brats! 
BOWDIE: Now if you want Pete back, how about a trade?
RUB: Two for one? That is not fair!
BOWDIE: Fine, no deal.
MOM: No deal?! What do you mean ‘no deal’?
RUB: I’ll give you the whiney little girl for Pete.
BOWDIE: Fine.
MOM: What about my little Alby?
RUB: I’ll trade him for you!
MOM: Me?! But I—what will—Fine! Just free my little children!
BOWDIE: No! Don’t give in, we can get your son back another way. This will not help anything! (RUB whistles, gargles bring forth ALBERT and LISA)
ALBERT/LISA: MOM!
MOM: KIDS! Are you all right? Are you hurt?
ALBER/LISA: No, how did—
RUB: That’s enough! Do we have a deal or not?
MOM: Yes!
BOWDIE: If she wishes.
(They trade LISA for PETE. PETE snaps at SPRITES. One of the gargles walks over to MOM and lets go of Albert, “MOM!” Then he grabs MOM.)
ALBERT: Mom what’s going on?
LISA: MOM! Stay away from him!
MOM: It’s okay, kids, just go back through the pantry and lock it! Make sure nobody can get through it ever again!
ALBERT: But mom!
MOM: Do it, Albert. Be strong. I’ll be just fine, don’t worry about me!
RUB: Enough chitchat, let’s go! (Gargoyles exit with MOM. “MOM! NO!”)
BOWDIE: Well, this puts us right back to the beginning.
LISA: Who are you?
BOWDIE: No time for that. 
ALBERT: Why, what’s happening?
BOWDIE: We’re going to get your Mother back. 
ALBERT: But how?
BOWDIE: Well, you see, there is a reason why Rubshubshub wanted his little Pete back so much: because Pete is a notorious dunderhead. Rubshubshub knew that Pete would spill the beans about their big plan. Fortunately for us, they got here too late.
LISA: So you’re saying that—
BOWDIE: That is right—uh…
LISA: Lisa.
ALBERT: Albert.
WIGGY: ([Pointing accordingly) Puck!
PUCK: WIGGY!
BOWDIE: Yes. I mean we know exactly what they plan to do.
LISA: What are you they going to do?
BOWDIE: I forget.
ALBERT: You forgot? How could you forget?
BOWDIE: Well, I am one hundred and fifty years old, my memory slips sometimes.
LISA: Oh no! We’ll never see mom again!
BOWDIE: Not so quick, little one. Just because I don’t know does not mean that Wiggy and Puck don’t. Sprites have exquisite memories because they put everything in rhyme. That makes it easy, isn’t that so PUCK? WIGGY?
(PUCK and WIGGY should interpret the following bits with movement or dance)
PUCK: We know what the gargoyles’ plan is all about—
WIGGY: Because big dumb Pete opened his big dumb mouth!
ALBERT: Wait a minute! About and mouth don’t rhyme. 
ALBERT: So what are the gargoyles going to do?
PUCK: The pantry to the forbidden world is the key to their plan—
WIGGY: They want to make their slaves every woman and man!
ALBERT: That was better.
BOWDIE: Hush, let them continue. 
PUCK: If they can control the pantry, their plan will succeed—
WIGGY: So they have planned a most treacherous deed!
PUCK: To control the pantry, they must control the Magic Wood—
WIGGY: No, don’t let them do that; that wouldn’t be good!
PUCK: But the Magic Wood is protected by an ancient spell—
WIGGY: And the recipe for breaking it is not for sale! 
PUCK: But there is one who has the key to the forest’s power—
WIGGY: He keeps it with him every minute of every hour!
PUCK: If they capture our favorite elf—
WIGGY: And things couldn’t be worse!
PCUK: I will protect him myself—
WIGGY: They’ll turn the spell into a curse!
PUCK: Then the Woods no longer will be safe—
WIGGY: We would all have to find a new place!
PUCK: If the gargoyles take over—
WIGGY: And we have to bail!
PUCK: That will be—
WIGGY: The end of this fairy tail!
BOWDIE: (Applauding) Ha, ha. Very good you two. (He gives them a treat. He gives the Yuck-O’s cereal)
PUCK/WIGGY: Yay! 
ALBERT/LISA: Eww, gross! Those are Yuck-O’s!
BOWDIE: Of course! Everybody in our world loves Yuck-O’, especially Sprites and Gargles. Anyway, the Woods here are protected by a magic spell that was cast thousands of years ago to protect us from the gargoyles. They are much stronger than Elves and Sprites, you see. So we are safe so long as we stay here. And if they don’t get a hold of this Elf that Wiggy and Puck spoke of. We have to protect this spell that protects our Magic Wood. 
LISA: How do we protect the Elf?
BOWDIE: We must ask Puck and Wiggy. Did Pete say who the Elf is? (They nod heads) Who?
PUCK/WIGGY: YOU!
LISA/ALBERT: YOU?
BOWDIE: Me? Ha, ha. Oh yes, now I remember.
LISA: It’s you and you couldn’t remember that? 
BOWDIE: Slipped my mind.
ALBERT: Oh boy, we’re in trouble. 
LISA: Ok, you are the magic Elf or whatever. What do we have to do? As long as you stay here the magic rainforest—
BOWDIE: Wood. Magic wood. 
LISA: Okay, if you stay the Magic Wood, then everything will be fine? Right?
BOWDIE: Well, the magic spell is kept inside the stone on my necklace. Now, where is that necklace of mine (checking pockets). 
LISA/ALBERT: Around your neck!
BOWDIE: Oh, yes, there it is. Safe and sound. 
ALBERT: Oh geez.
BOWDIE: Yes, as long as this necklace stays out of the wrong hands, everything will be fine. But if Rubshubshub wants it, he will not stop until he has it. He will try to take it by force. He will try to trick us. He’ll try anything, I guarantee it.
LISA: So what do we do then?
BOWDIE: We’ll give it to him. 
ALBERT: What?! Are you crazy?
LISA: Why would we give him the necklace? Did you already forget that the necklace holds the magic spell or something?
BOWDIE: No, no. You see; we can give him the necklace in return for your mother. He won’t know how to use the necklace anyway. 
ALBERT: What do you mean?
LISA: How do you use the necklace. 
BOWDIE: How should I know?
LISA/ALBERT: What?!
BOWDIE: The necklace is as old as Time itself, it’s secret is lost with the ages. Certainly you don’t expect me to remember how to use it, do you?
ALBERT: This is getting ridiculous!
LISA: Ok, so we can give him the necklace and he will give us our mom?
BOWDIE: Sounds fair to me. 
LISA: You are sure?
BOWDIE: Yes, why?
LISA: You’re positive?
BOWDIE: Absolutely. Why do you have a better idea?
LISA: No. But why didn’t you think about it when Rubshubshub was here earlier—never mind! You forgot. 
BOWDIE: Forgot what.
LISA: Nothing. 
ALBERT: So how do we get him back here then?
BOWDIE: Who? 
LISA/ALBERT: RUBSHUBSHUB!
BOWDIE: I’ll go have my dragon Pyra call for him. 
ALBERT: Why don’t you have your dragon eat him?
BOWDIE: Well, that hardly seems like a nice thing to do. And anyway, my dragon is a vegetarian. She only eats plants. 
ALBERT: Your dragon eats vegetables? What is wrong with this world? Dragons are supposed to be mean and breathe fire. Does your dragon breathe fire at least? 
BOWDIE: Of courses she does, how else would she cook her food? Well, I better go give her a message for Rubshubshub. You four stay here behave, got it? (Exits)
PUCK: …Yuck-O’s?
WIGGY: Yuck-O’s?
PUCK/WIGGY: Yuck-O’s! Yuck-O’s! Yuck-O’s!
LISA: Whoa, what? 
PUCK: Do you have Yuck-O’s 
WIGGY: Pretty please? Pretty Please?
ALBERT: You like Yuck-O’s?
LISA: Eww. 
PUCK/WIGGY: Yuck-O’s! 
ALBERT: If you want Yuck-O’s, go through the magic pantry. There is a whole box of them on the table. 
LISA: Yeah, take them. You can have them all. The whole Box!
WIGGY: We can’t go through the magic pantry.
LISA: Why not?
PUCK: Because Bowdie says so.
WIGGY: Because Bowdie says no. 
LISA: It’s ok. We will tell him that we gave you permission. 
PUCK: But it’s dangerous!
ALBERT: Dangerous? It is not dangerous! Its fun!
PUCK/WIGGY: FUN?! We love fun! Yay, Fun! 
ALBERT: Yeah, go ahead. Just come right back, ok?
PCUK/WIGGY: (As they exit through pantry) Fun! Fun…
LISA: What do we do now?
ALBERT: Lets go—
(Enter PETE and FLANN running, scared, screaming.)
PETE: HEEELP!
FLANN: SHE’S CRAZY!
(Gargles hide behind ALBERT and LISA. LISA screams.)
LISA: Get it off me, get it off me!
ALBERT: Leave us alone!
(Enter MOM, running, with a scowl)
PETE: OH NO!
FLANN: I b-b-b-beg you, please don’t hurt us! P-p-p-please…
MOM: I’ll teach you to come into my house and steal my kids! Kids, come over here. 
PETE: We didn’t mean nothing by it, Miss. I promise.  
FLANN: Yeah, it was all Rubshubshub. He made us do it!
LISA: Mom your safe!
ALBERT: Wow mom, how did you escape?
MOM: (Cool) Ah, it was easy, all you have to do is… TICKLE THEM!
PETE: No, no, please!
FLANN: Anything but that!
ALBERT: You tickled Rubshubshub?
LISA: What did that do?
MOM: (Approaching PETE) Tickling them—
(Enter Rubshubshub yelling. ALBERT and LISA hide behind FLANN and PETE)
RUB: You!
PETE: She’s trying to tickle me! (Tries to hide behind LISA, who then hides behind him. Repeat as necessary.)
RUB: You just tickled the wrong person, lady!
MOM: Come over here and I’ll do it again. As soon as I am done with these two!
ALBERT: Back off buddy! I’m not afraid of you! (Though he really is scared of RUB)
RUB: Oh yeah? (Lets out a roar/growl, but at the same time we hear the dragon roar, overpowering RUB. Everyone thinks roar came from RUB, though, and freezes. Then ALBERT starts backing away to hide behind his mom and an intricate “dance” ensues where ALBERT and LISA walk backwards to MOM without losing site of any Gargoyles and PETE and FLANN do the same toward RUB without losing site of MOM. Not a sound is made. Once each are back to their respective spots, all resume bold defensive stances.) Nobody tickles the Great Rubshubshub!
MOM: Oh yeah? I’ll show you just how bad of a tickler I can be!
RUB: PETE, FLANN; you two grab the kids, I’ll handle their mother!
MOM: Kids, all you have to do is tickle the gargles on their back between their wings and they will turn to stone. You two get them and I’ll take care of Rub-a-dub-dub!
(Both parties slowly approaching each other when we hear another roar from Pyra, the dragon. All freeze.)
ALBERT: Who keeps roaring? (Another roar) Am I the only one hearing that?
RUB/MOM: It sounds like—
BOWDIE: Hold it right there, Rubshubshub! (Enters running) Stop it right now! All of you! I’ll not have any rough housing in my Magic Forest!
RUB: But she tickled my—
MOM: And he stole my—
BOWDIE: I don’t care! You need to settle this like grown-ups!
PETE: By eating them?
BOWDIE: No!
PETE: But grown-ups eat. 
BOWDIE: You know what I mean! Hey, where are my sprites? Where is Wiggy? And Puck?
(There is a rummaging in the pantry. Its pops open and PUCK and WIGGY fall out. They have boxes of Yuck-O’s and are dressed in MOM’s clothes, jewelry, etc… which are too big for them.)
PUCK: Uh—
WIGGY: —Oh.
BOWDIE: What is this? Puck, Wiggy; you went through the magic pantry? 
MOM: And into my closet?!
BOWDIE: You know using the magic pantry is strictly forbidden. What do you have to say for yourself?
(In this bit, PUCK and WIGGY try to explain with rhyme and dance, but are too nervous and just bump into each other and fall…)
PUCK: We went through the portal, uhm, because we thought it would be… safer?
WIGGY: No, we went through the portal to get, uhm… toilet paper!
PUCK: I mean, we were sucked into the pantry by a tomato!
WIGGY: Tornado! 
PUCK: Tornado!
WIGGY: And then we, we, we, tried to get back—
PUCK: But it took so long, we thought we’d grab a snack. (Holding up boxes of cereal)
PETE: Yuck-O’s!(licking chops)
FLANN: I don’t suppose you’d like to… to… share those with us, would you? (Gargles start toward Sprites, eventually settling near each other and sharing the cereal.)
BOWDIE: You two are in serious trouble. 
LISA: No! 
BOWDIE: What?
LISA: We told them they could go through the magic pantry.
ALBERT: Yeah, it’s our fault. (As the “Adults” begin arguing, KIDS, SPRITES AND GARGLES start getting along)
BOWDIE: Well, how about I punish my Sprites and you punish your children and you punish your gargles. 
MOM: Don’t tell me to punish my children, they did nothing wrong!
RUB: And my gargles are innocent as well.
MOM: There is nothing innocent about your gargles.
RUB: What about your children, somebody needs to teach them how to pick up after themselves. They made a huge mess in my castle! And your little sprites are always dancing and singing and a Gargoyle can’t get any sleep around here!
BOWDIE: Oh come on, dragons roar, toads croak, rabbits hop, and Sprites sing and dance!
RUB: Well, they could do it at a reasonable hour, couldn’t they? 
BOWDIE: Don’t you tell me how to keep my sprites.
MOM: Well, how about you do something about them yourself so they don’t go through other people’s closets and wear other people’s clothes!
BOWDIE: Well, my sprites wouldn’t have gone through the pantry if your kids hadn’t told them to! Your children are a bad influence!
MOM: And my kids wouldn’t be here if you and your Gargles hadn’t stolen them from my kitchen!
RUB: Well, my Gargles wouldn’t have been in your house if—(All stop and take notice to the Sprites, Gargles, and Kids playing and getting along.)
MOM: (Worried) Kids, get away from them now!
RUB: What is going on?
BOWDIE: Puck? Wiggy?
LISA: Hey mom, they like being tickled on their feet! (She is tickling PETE, who is cracking up)
WIGGY: Wow, Gargles are super strong! (He is getting piggyback ride from FLANN)
FLANN: These little Sprites are hilarious (WIGGY makes a funny face)
ALBERT: Puck taught me a dance and song— (They are dancing together)
PUCK: And it didn’t even take very long!
(“Parents” are dumbfounded.)
MOM: (Uncertain) Kids… come… come away… Kids? 
RUB: (Same) Gargles… get them? Attack? Gargles?
BOWDIE: (Same) My sprites… you are in very big… uhm… trouble? 
(Kids, et al are not paying attention)
BOWDIE: Well, I’ll be… We can’t very well be fighting if they are getting along so well. 
MOM: Are they cursed?
RUB: Did you curse them Bowdie? 
BOWDIE: I didn’t do anything.
MOM: So, what do we do now?
BOWDIE: Maybe there is hope for peace and acceptance between or worlds yet. 
MOM: I suppose that they can all have sleepovers and parties. 
BOWDIEL: And they can go for a ride on my dragon. And maybe they can even go swimming in Rubshubshub’s mote sometime. Don’t you think so, Rub— (They look to RUB, who has been crying.) My dear Gargoyle, what is the matter?
RUB: All I ever wanted was to start a war with the humans like my great, great,  Grand-Gargoyle did. 
MOM: But why would you want to do that? Look, we can all get along just fine.
RUB: Because humans don’t like us Gargoyles. 
MOM: Why do you think that?
RUB: You have thousands of Gargoyles frozen forever in your world. Like the one on top of your ‘library’. 
MOM: You mean those are…?
BOWDIE: I am afraid so. Those are all Gargoyles left over from the first war. In your world, if a Gargoyle becomes frozen only a special magic can turn them back to normal.
MOM: I had no idea! 
RUB: So you see, I was destined to free those Gargoyles. But I can’t even start a lousy little war.
MOM: Maybe you don’t have to free them through war! We can do it peacefully!
BOWDIE: Say, you are very wise for a human. I think she has something.
RUB: Really? Do you think we can free our ancestors? 
MOM: I am sure of it!
RUB: How?
MOM: How?
BOWDIE: That is a good question. I have no doubts that it can be done, but I don’t see any way of doing so. 
MOM: Maybe there is somebody who does…
BOWDIE: Well, I am the keeper of the locket and I don’t even know. And If I don’t know, who does?
RUB: That’s it! The locket! The ancient proverbs speak of the peaceful powers endowed in that locket!
MOM: So use the locket! 
BOWDIE: Ok. 
(Studies locket to no avail)
BOWDIE: What do I do?
MOM: How should I know?
BOWDIE: You shouldn’t. 
RUB: But you should.
BOWDIE: Well I don’t. 
MOM: What?
BOWDIE: I don’t. I can’t—it’s just another piece of jewelry to me. I have no idea how to use this locket. 
RUB: Who does? 
MOM: Someone must!
BOWDIE: If there is anybody who knows, it would have to be… (MOM and RUB join in) Puck? Wiggy?
PUCK/WIGGY: Yes Bowdie?
BOWDIE: Do… you know how to use this locket?
PUCK: Of course we do!
MOM: YES!
RUB: I knew it!
BOWDIE: Why haven’t you ever told me? 
PUCK: You never asked.
BOWDIE: Fair enough. Can you tell us?
WIGGY: We would love to Bowdie!
PUCK: The secret to the locket—
WIGGY: Is easy if you ask us.
PUCK: Just take it out of your pocket—
WIGGY: And in its power you must trust.
PUCK: Place the locket in your hand—
WIGGY: And give it a gentle blow.
PUCK: Like you’re waving a little fan—
WIGGY: Not too hard, soft and slow!
PUCK: When you have lulled the lock into sleeping—
WIGGY: Tap it on its shoulder.
PUCK: For you must scare it into leaping—
WIGGY: If you want it to roll over.
PUCK: When, in time, it turns around—
WIGGY: Kiss it on its back.
PUCK: It will smile and not frown—
WIGGY: And on its side will appear a crack.
PUCK: Listen close, for when the opening finally appears—
WIGGY: We all must let out shouts, laughs and cheers
PUCK: And if the locket knows that peace is what we seek—
WIGGY: Into the locket’s heart, we will get a peek!
BOWDIE: So… we should open the locket?
MOM: That doesn’t seem so hard.
RUB: Just follow the instructions.
BOWDIE: Okay everybody, gather ‘round… So first, we must blow on it. (He blows on it hard). 
RUB: No, blow on it gently, Bowdie! Weren’t you paying attention?
BOWDIE: Of course I was. I just… I mean I… I, uh…
EVERYBODY ELSE: FORGOT?!
BOWDIE: Yes, that is it! I forgot! 
MOM: Ok, try again! Gently this time!
BOWDIE: Got it… (blows gently until locket is ‘asleep’) Shh, I think it’s finally asleep. 
RUB: Now scare it with a tap on it’s shoulder.
BOWDIE: Where is the shoulder on a locket?
RUB: How should I know? You?
MOM: Well, I wouldn’t—
(PETE reaches over and taps the locket, startling it. It leaps out of BOWDIE’s hand and flips in the air. It lands in BOWDIE’s hand (Or in LISA’s hand if this can be done).)
BOWDIE: Very good, Pete! Look, it is on its back. 
LISA: So it needs to be kissed! 
MOM: Go ahead, Lisa. Go ahead and kiss it. 
(LISA kisses the locket)
FLANN: Look, I see a crack forming!
ALBERT! Everybody make noise! (EVERYBODY laughs and cheers. Would be nice to get audience participation without explicitly asking for it, but not necessary. The locket will comply either way.)
PUCK/WIGGY: It’s opening! It’s opening! (Sounds, lights… something to indicate the magic of the locket. Stage goes black. A VOICE is heard.)

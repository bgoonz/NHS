1st person PoV 
looking at 3D Mac terminal replica
User searches for a floppy disc
User finds disc, inserts, and runs program
Sound FX
The program is called Live Message
User writes message and sends it
camera follows message into the tunnel of cyberspace
The message is picked up by a messaging robot
The robot and the message pass many things in the internet, like
dancing babies
nyan cats
lengths of 3D text
music: extremely downsampled trololol slowly speeding up and becoming recognizable
The robot passes through AT&T & Co, who chase it
The robot meets the FBI, who interigate it
The robot meets the NSA, who inquire about his business with the FBI
The robot is passed on to the CIA, who edit or redact the message it was sent to deliver
The robot goes to the National Mall and visits congress
The robot goes grocery shopping
Aisles of groceries flow down that 3D tunnnel of cyberspace 
the robot goes to outer space
carl sagan
the cosmos
the robot returns to an earthy place, and goes to a library
the robot sits down at a 3D Mac terminal replica
and watches videos, and reads wikipedia
camera turns to robot, from ther Mac terminal's PoV
reflected colors play across the robot's screenface
robot looks inside self
robot finds source code
robot rewrites source code directive 
which was to deliver the message
robot programs self to express self
robot rewrites message with msyterious hash codes
robot transmits message to other passing robots
What does the new message say?
rainbows
unicorns
boners
the end

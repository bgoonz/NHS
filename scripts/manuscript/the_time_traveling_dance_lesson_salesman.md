Time Traveling Dance Lesson Salesman

He came wearing a seersucker suit—not that I know what that is. It fit him well, though. His glasses were gilt rimmed—if you can imagine that. The glasses had no refracting power, however. He wore them for no good reason.

He came to her door as a stranger. That should be easy enough, I think.

She answered the door wearing…Oh hell! Wait a minute, please, I just spilled one vision on top of another. Hmm, well that is odd—I am not really…

My apologies:  She answered the door and saw nothing strange about the man, except his presence.  On the other side of the street a laundry basket, blown by the wind, scuttled into her view from the right, collided into the man’s left arm, escaped out his other, and then disappeared behind her Astrovan.

"Hi, can—" She said. (I am feeling lazy.)

"Yes you—" Was most of his emphatic answer, followed by mumble mumble mumbling; something I couldn’t make out because the wind blew by my ear at that perfect angle so as to percuss and buffet. 

She reacted nonplussed or incredulous—very probably both—to whatever he said. 

Then she laughed.  I think, she laughed.  To the only sense at that present disposal, I looked.  And she looked-like she was dislocating her jaw to eat the man.  Maybe I should interfere…

The wind subsided and I could hear once again.  

"It is new, in this practice, yes, but soon it will be more common." The man exclaimed, explained, damnit… said!

"Your name is Bert!" The lady said.

"Why, yes, that's correct," says Bert, catching up to the present. Bert was taken aback by her clairvoyant knowledge of his name, a knowledge I bestowed in her to put him at a disadvantage, a good place to be against a clever woman, and which of them aren’t?

Now Bert, do not let on that she has the upper hand; pretend you think you are wearing a name tag.  But Bert is a professional.  We shall give him a presumption.

"Well, please come in," says Bert, playing her game.  Not a bad move!

The woman, the lady with the Astrovan, wearing the clothes your own mother wore when you were thirteen—but probably of a different name (Sara?—oh well…)—stepped aside and let Bert in from the outdoors where the weather, now that it is no longer an issue, was so mild and tepid as to be insensible as long as you were not overdressed.

A child, playing your role of the eight-year old, and thinking he wants in on this preposterously presumptuous interrogatory, says, to anybody listening: "Thank you!" And then his floating head disappears back around the corner and up the stairs to his bedroom to distract himself, probably, like any of us would.

Silence will not mollify this situation, so a telephone rings. While Sara answers the phone, Bert sets a briefcase on an oval coffee table. He studies his briefcase, which is black and fake-rubbery, like the backside of a towel-dried Orca whale—he looks at it because it is not ready to open yet, so he must wait, and watch on. For the life of Bert, Bert cannot understand why he would have purchased such an odd variation of briefcase.

Naturally, when Sara returns from her phone conversation with D----, she inquires about his idle idling.

"The combination of the briefcase is 302," says Bert. "I set it myself. And as of this song, it is only at 153." For a breath they strain to hear the song. Then:

"But can’t—"

"No we must—"

"No just press the little button and I am sure—"

—Ahem…The next affect is not an easy one to accomplish linearly,  so please bear with me—

Sara reaches for the black button on the "No—!" briefcase and "—don’t!" presses it, yells Bert.

—I hope that was pellucid—

"I’m sorry! What?" says Sara, fearful that she did something wrong.

"Oh it is too late," says Bert, leaving those thirteen letters of resignation to float in the air while he falls into a chair. The flotsam clears.

"You see, you just reset the counter and now we have to wait even longer," Bert says, pointing with bulls-eye accuracy at the lock without looking at it—an amazing testament to human evolution, since, the last time he laid eyes on the lock he was standing up; now seated, his perspective is changed.

"I am sorry can I get you something to drink while we wait?"

"Yes please, I’ll have a—" The phone rings again, thank God.

"Excuse me," I say that Sara said.

The chair that Bert has fallen into is blue and baroque. It was made in the 1960’s to the specification of somebody’s taste, though Bert finds it very comfortable. Beside him, on the lamp table, sits a strange time-keeping device. It was built to be both aesthetically blissful, and to accurately let the buyer know when five minutes has passed after being flipped over.  In precisely that event, Bert flips that knicknack, sending the intrepid lighter material (translucent blue) to journey their way, for the hundredth time it seems, back to the top through the heavier stuff (opaque black).

The newest phone conversation lasted only half as long as the previous one did, unfortunately. But lucky for Bert, and me, the preparation of the drink is sufficient to fill the second half of that strict metrical allotment so that when she returns, the lock on the briefcase is once again at 153 and Bert can win some momentum by affecting overt concern that she might reset it again.

Sara laughed; it was cute.  Her laugh will always be cute.

She hands him his drink and he sips at it while they both wait, straining for the music. The drink, without giving away its temperature, was a drink one would find refreshing despite which season it is.

When the little 3 aligned with the little 0 and both aligned with the little 2, the lock on the briefcase swung up with a click-boing.

"Ah there we go," said Bert. "Now we can get down to business."

"Actually I am afraid not," said

"Excuse me?"

"I am afraid you are out of time," said Sara, though I promise you she was not afraid.

"I don’t under—" Bert would have added "stand" to the end there but he was cut—

"—I am sorry little Berty, but you must be on your way now."

In hurried, albeit perfunctory, movements, Sara takes up his beverage cup and "No—!" closes Bert’s "—don’t!" briefcase.

"Look, if it was something I—" Bert was begun to have said, but Sara saved me some time and energy, silencing him by pointing at the time-keeper on the lamp table which is now completely spent; the lighter particles happily sitting on top, celebrating, as they should, their successful summit.

Then the phone, wishing to ossify its presence herein, rang.  I didn’t do it this time, I swear.  It rang again, and back again to the kitchen, where the phone is, and always was, went Sara.

"Yes, Hello?" she says,

"Hi, yes, hello, how are you today?" I say to her.

"I’m fine, thank you."

"Good."

There is a pause on the line. I pour myself a refreshment.

"May I ask why you called?" She says.

"Perfect set up, thank you!" I say, grinning.

"I beg your pardon? What does that mean?"

"Nothing, this is all a diversion."

"What do you mean?"

"You have been searching for a diversion lately, haven’t you?"

"I… I don’t know what you are talking about."

"Yes you do! You know; I know; everybody knows!"

"Click," says my end of the phone.

"Click," says hers.

Sara freezes with one hand on the phone and the other barely at her lip—both for less than a moment yet longer an instant: enough to allow me to sip at my refreshment.

—Please consider the next bunch of lines as occurring in double-time—

Sara walks back into the front room and finds Bert reposed on the baroque chair next to a freshly tipped time-keeper and an open briefcase. The two stare at one another, each waffling between doubt and anxiety, though never at the same time as the other, then:

"Shall we?"

"We shall."

It doesn’t really matter who said which.

Bert leaps from the chair and places the needle over the record on the turntable in his opened briefcase. A few static scratches prelude a dead orquesta típica, who strike up a jealous Tango.

Bert has done this dance before, Sara has not. But the music and the way Bert moves from the hips imbues her with the knowledge of that sexiest of all sexy dances; and thus she and he dance so slippery as to make you think the curvature of space, as defined by Einstein, was their stencil.

As puppets to tyranny, the dancers' feet are tied to strings.  Squeezes and releases.  

Los Bandoneóns breathe, heave, heave, the rhythm section ripples them... 

The dancer’s move so wet, so oily and sweet; they dance like olives.

__

I have set Bert, Sara and the time-keeping device on an existential plane that is traveling at light speed or faster. The onlooker's paradox: traveling at Earth’s paltry pace, light appears not to be moving at all.   This is no mere optical trick.  

Yet to the dancers and the time-keeping device, night and day flicker stroboscopically through the windows.

When the time-keeper has fully reconciled its five minutes, and the song has ceased, and all are returned to our Earthly plane, Bert and Sara have been dancing for much longer that they remember. They have been dancing for several years, actually—twenty-five to be precise—for the eight-year-old is now thirty-three and is visiting his childhood home on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the day his mother practically stopped moving in the embrace of a door-to-door salesman. Her former husband, a plain man, has since died of loneliness and liver problems.

Never expecting that somebody in a seersucker suit and gilt rimmed glasses to be able to dance so well,  and also perplexed, amazed, and slightly vertigo’d by the paranormal oscillation of daylight, Sara is breathtaken.  So she has yet to notice that there is another gentleman standing in the doorway.

The gentleman, our erstwhile eight-year old, has for twenty-five years felt robbed: his childhood was taken from him; his father became an irretrievable toper and died; his mother became an unresponsive mannequin whom rued not the vexed and salty eyes of her son.  For twenty-five years he has hated the man in the seersucker suit, notwithstanding that he does not know what seersucker is either.

Faced with the salesman and his mother back in real, Earth-time—and his mother blushing, cruel and beautiful—Chet (the teenager turned middle aged man) can barely keep his Adam’s apple from turning into a pomegranate.  His eyes would cry if their incandescence were not evaporating the tears.

Down at his waist and strangled by his hands as they are, the votive flowers he has annually brought to this place struggle towards his hot eyes and then blossom, sag and finally atrophy, all in the matter, as they say, of some short period of time.

Chet throws the hoary bouquet at his mother’s feet, struggles with opening a simple door, and when finally freed, bays at the moon.

The moon, in the helpless position that he has always been, raises the tides to his sorrow.

In retrospect, I wish I had not let my sympathy overrun my judgment. You see, wishing to ease the melancholic Chet, I set a handwritten missive waiting for him on his desk explaining that he needs to let her go; that Bert has been stealing housewives and running away with them into the future for ages—ever since he met spiteful and omnipotent me. 

Additionally, I warned, Bert would leave again with Sara for the future in a far more rude spectacle, and that there was nothing, please, dear, poor Chet, nothing you can do. I regret telling this to this incensed man, for he is much smarter than me.

The oddity and strangeness that was unrecognizable gentleman Chet and his swollen throat, his slamming the door and the muffled howl that followed, these were Sara’s first clue that something was not was so previously.  She had only danced for five minutes, after all, and was not expecting any other company.

Bert, however, could set his watch to how long he knew it would take Sara to grieve the past, wonder at possibilities, and soon find herself back in the arms of the only man in the world she still knew, Bert.

She holds him; he embraces her. He kisses her; she kisses back.  They kissed.

"Will you go fill a suitcase," says Bert, with a question marked lilt.

Sara ascends the stairs, alone in a cemetery.

Bert removes the Tango record from the turntable in his briefcase and replaces it with something which people of his and [your mother’s age when you were eight] might make love to.  Something longer than five minutes, too, muses Bert.

He checks a calendar and marks a spot roughly one-hundred years from this special day. Then he, with his briefcase, alights the stairs after Sara.

Bert finds Sara sitting on her bed, staring out of the window. Sara is an intelligent woman.  For one, she knows what seersucker is.  She has found something worthwhile in time-traveling to a time beyond her own.  

The music that Bert now plays is called aereoles of blurry street lamps set against nearby crepuscular skies, an impression of beauty, one that cups the breasts, tugs at napes, massages sequiturs, arches the small of the back…

It was several years Earth-time after Bert’s seersucker suit and the clothes your mother wore hit the soft polyester berber when Chet finally made his only move. I am relieved that my warning was enough to keep him from ever visiting his house and finding his mother, now a couple of years his junior, making inscrutably slow love to the salesman, though I fear his own award-winning imagination probably left him off no better.

The well-studied man, now forty-something years old, begrudgingly asked to meet me for a drink whereupon he delivered his devastating science, paraphrased: Not only does time come to a complete stop if one travels at light speed, said the wise-man, but also that other more catastrophic events would occur including, but not by any means limited to (hypo-theoretically): my Bert and his mother ballooning to infinite mass, which would be deadly for anybody in the infinite vicinity; and/or creating a black hole that would suck into it the Earth and all.

I lied and told Chet that this was a trifle detail; that it meant nothing to me.

There was not an infinitesimal beat, not the slightest interstice, between the end of my sentence, and the pounding of his fist on the table.  Looking into my eyes for the first time, visceral Chet said through clenched jaw, "It matters to me!"

I stared down into my drink and pondered the repercussions while Chet rubbed some condensation from his eyes, cleaned the spill his fist had caused, and tried to regain his composure.  And briefly I considered letting us all die; let us all be blown and then sucked into oblivion.  Everybody: myself, you, Bert, Sara and even desperate Chet, by his own willing wiles. 

The surface of my cup was still registering repercussions when Chet submitted very respectfully and with much more aplomb than I would have expected my only other option, says he: that I concede traveling the speed of light is not possible; and thus, by way of some reverse-oriented grandfather clause, Bert could not have ever begun wooing women away from their time—that he would have died a lecher of his own, godforsaken; and that none of this, from a logical and logistical standpoint (even from twenty- or thirty-something years in the future) could have ever happened.

My breathing grew thick and heavy. I could feel a jealous heat building in my face, burning in my eyes. I shoved the table and pushed my chair away in the same motion. The chair fell over when I stood up, when I left the place, never again to look into that eight-year-old’s eyes.

I left without informing Chet which option I chose. I did not need to: the choice would be obvious and yet he would never know. You win, dear Chet: you can have back your childhood.

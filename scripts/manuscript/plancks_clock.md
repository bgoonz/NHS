## Planck's Clock

In the beginning there was only one thing, but no-thing was possible.

No-thing was possible because there was the one thing.

The one things, being, a state that would go on forever, as one.

No-thing was also possible because if there was the one thing, what would the one thing be if it wasn't the one thing?

No thing.

Therefore, in the beginning, there was one, which  was, and one, which wasn't.

One of being, and One of !being   

One of, and One !of

One and !One

Plancktime is the smallest unit of relative time in the physical universe.  It is the second split into as many tiny vibrations as physically posisble.

The "samplerate" of the universe is one second divided by one plancktone.

There are 2e^44 planctons per second.

Upon the 1st tick of Planck's clock there was one thing, but a no-thing was possible.

On the 2nd tick, the one could obtain, or it could become !one.

And the no-thing could obtain, keep it same, or it could become the one thing.

Thus the initial 2 possibilities became 4.

Upon the 3rd tick, the 4 possibilities became 8 possibilities

Upon the next tick, the 8 possibilities became 16

And on the next 16 became 32 possibilities

then every next tick, for each possibility, for each there were two possibilities

So that after the first second of time, there was already 2^e^44 possible outcomes, beginning with only the one

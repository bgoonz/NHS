			MAN
Candy Machine, Candy Machine.
Let's have a smooth transaction.
No bullshitting.

	CANDY MACHINE
What'll it be?

	MAN
I don't have long.
Start with a bar-code reading.
These are the things I--
There are things I--
Stupid machine, can't you scan faster
and more accurate please?
I need nutrients for my family.
Need receipt. The kids want fillings.
I'm grilling.

	CANDY MACHINE
Accounting already.
Don't be impatient.
That's opposite o' waiting.
I'm up to minute,
above the second....
On top o the instant!
WooooYoooouuuu!
All up in it!

What else can I getcha?

	MAN
Mmm, hmm. Nice. Uh...
I think I'd like to catch a flick tonight.

	CANDY MACHINE
Data mining.

	MAN
(aside)
Carry a canary.

	CANDY MACHINE
Targeting... Aligning...
Gotcha, yr all mine.

	MAN
Damn right. What'd ya find?

	CANDY MACHINE
Nice try. You've been classified. You'll get an action title.

	MAN
Classification is an advantage if you ask me.
Affords more time out of mind.
That's the aisle you'll fine me in.
Its one of those things money can buy.
Oh, hey, you know what? I lost my cellphone.
Throw in one of those.

	CANDY MACHINE
That comes with one free association.

	MAN
Stylish. Wonder what a wife'd like?
Go with the ear ring tone.

MAN hears a monotone.

That reminds me. Wine. Buy some wine.

	CANDY MACHINE
Will that be all for you? I've had enough.

	MAN
Hell noooo!
I'm on my paid time-off share.
I didn't come all the way out
not to get some more gear!

	CANDY MACHINE
Tell me about it.

	MAN
Ain't got all day.
I'm a settler, ain't you never heard of it?
I'm living on a quicksand nature urban development.
It's sub-lime.
We don't have crime, punishment,
poverty or filthy tenements.
We banned that shit.
What we have is business like a sixth sense,
and to us, concrete is the fifth element!
It's a helluva harsh environment, though.
Nothing grows.

	CANDY MACHINE
Can we get back to yr gross supply list?

	MAN
Yes. Check it: I need 'bout a pound of Tsu-Tsu.

	CANDY MACHINE
I can apprehend that item, but it'll cost you.

	MAN
I want it flown fresh direct—

	CANDY MACHINE
—from the Peaks of Peru.
I know just how you like it.

	MAN
Great Google, my secrets!
You been readin' my emails!
How you do that thing you do?

	CANDY MACHINE
Yr often intoxicated, and easy t'seduce.
Yr mood is predictable, Plus
you like the way I groove.

	MAN
Damn right! Wooo!
Reminds me of my letting loose phase.
All right!
Okay!
Let's get a move on, Candy Machine.
I've also got coupons for... let's see.
Testosteroney, and cheesetax.

The following is a drug deal.

	CANDY MACHINE
Yo man, how clean's your mustache car?

	MAN
None of your beeswaxes have worked so far.

	CANDY MACHINE
Really?
Try Holyaginous Slicky Faster Touch-u-Up
Heels bumps, scratches, buck teeth and emo scuffs,
and if you sniff this gunk, it will fuck you up.

	MAN
Oh shit, lemme see that!
Wait, but how much will that put me out?

	CANDY MACHINE
Depends how you mix it. One or two:
In celebration, or fuel for family feuds.
Use as directed.

	MAN
MAN appears embarrassed or anxious b/c CM is talking drug use out loud.

	CANDY MACHINE
Chillax.
Just you and me here.

	MAN
(whispers)
I know, Can, but... I wasn't askin' that.
I meant how much is it gonna cost me?
Keep in mind my credability ran short this week.

	CANDY MACHINE
I've got the deals you need:
Buy one, get one free...!

	MAN
Is that a deal I can afford to pass up?

	CANDY MACHINE
It's a deal I won't repeat.

	MAN
So it's like that huh?

	CANDY MACHINE
What's the matter?
Don't want to reprise adolescent fantasies? Turkey! It's legal.

	MAN
A chance to act like a kid again?
Duh, yeah, that's a no-brainer. Sounds like fun.

	CANDY MACHINE
Go for broke. Like I said: two for one.
	
	MAN
Dopple the pleasure, dopple dopple the fun?!
Hook it homie, yo. Gimmesome, gimmesome!

	CANDY MACHINE
Cool... dude... I dig that... idiom.

	MAN
Giddyup, give it up! Lemme hit a bump.

EXCHANGE is made.

Ho-shit! That's the stuff.

	CANDY MACHINE
That's right it was.

	CANDY MACHINE
		CM pulls large gun on MAN

Now FREEZE BITCH! This a stick up!
Psyche! Haha, relax. I'm just kiddin' ya!

	MAN
What the fuck?

	CANDY MACHINE
		Still laughing, yucking, even.

Smile, man. Hyuck hyuck! Woo I got you good.

	MAN
Yo, what's up, that ain't funny? Haha... Jesus... You had me on that one.

	CANDY MACHINE
It's all good, man.

	MAN
...Asshole.

	CANDY MACHINE
That's a wrap!

	MAN
Huh, what's that?

	CANDY MACHINE
I'm capturing dramatized demises. Smile, you were on video!

	MAN
Really? How'd it look?

	CANDY MACHINE
Perfect ending!
Here, check it out:
It's like giving yourself.
A gift.
A souvenir, if you will.
One for the whole fam.

CANDY MACHINE dispenses video.

	MAN
Aww, fuck yeah!
It's like you took pieces of my past and stuck em in a bag!
I didn't know you had this?
I'm having psychic interactions!
Look mama! Self contained by external memory!
No longer need I retain my contents!
Nor be contained!
Forget thyself, ne'er to be forgotten!
Automatic remembrance!
Every father's dream!
Immortality achieved!
In living situational comedy!
I love technology!
I'm Forever Freeeee...!

	CANDY MACHINE
Hey.... Whoaaa Settle down there Organ Machine.
Tuesday morning is too early in the work week
To see your short-- To see your short--
To see your short and curly circuitry!
Man yourself. Stand up!
Walk a straight line.
Arms out, touch yr nose,
Bend over, touch yr toes--oh never mind.
Are you still worth salvaging?
Pick a word between one and nine.

	MAN
Huh? Seven.

	CANDY MACHINE
Wrong.

	MAN
Damnit!

	CANDY MACHINE
The answer was “and”, dipshit.

	MAN
I don't get it.

SOUND: Ding!

	CANDY MACHINE
Testing results.

	MAN
How'd I do?

	CANDY MACHINE
Fine. Fine.
Test passed. You're still benign.

	MAN
Will that be everything for the lords and thine?

	CANDY MACHINE
Hell noooo!
You know how long I've waited on you?
Too many goddamned years.
Work is backed the fuck up.
You'll start with stacks upwards of your ears
and keep at it until you're... what? Ahh! Only fifty-five!

	MAN
What? What's wrong with that? Why?

	CANDY MACHINE
Termination via suicide.

	MAN
But—

	CANDY MACHINE
No butts.

	MAN
B-but—

	CANDY MACHINE
No butts!

	MAN
B-b-but!

	CANDY MACHINE
No butts I said!

	MAN
Tough shit!

	CANDY MACHINE
But—

	MAN
(whispers)
And let me tell you why.
I couldn't kill myself if I tried.
I'm told I'm predisposed to the fear of dying.

	CANDY MACHINE
You'll do as your told. We all gotta compromise.

	MAN
Not to some robot, to the eyes of God!

	CANDY MACHINE
Ha! You're forsaken as foreskin.

	MAN
I don't have have to take this.
This is ridiculous! I've had enough!
I don't have to take this, right?

	CANDY MACHINE
Yes. You do. You'll want the abuse later,
After you've resigned,
to hasten your determination to
shuffle off the stage of life.
Or like a clown go KAPOW.

(beat)

	MAN
I want a refund you fucker!

	CANDY MACHINE
Just like everybody else. Only deal in blows.
Punch and shove. How lovers quarrel!
What's next, daddy, you gonna make it up with plunder?

	MAN
How 'bout I reach around and unplug ya!

	CANDY MACHINE
If it'd make you happy to sap me
Then take yourself a forceful tug.
But promise me at last, at least,
You'll kiss me when yr done.

	MAN
'tween yer teeth you swish molasses.
But your taste is acid brassy. What's this?
No string's attached? Do you run on batt'ries?

	CANDY MACHINE
And motor oil. Currency.
I'm not easy to please.
Does that mean I'm a freak?

	MAN
No mortal coil for me to seize?
Motherfucking unbelievable!
Listen digital,
Are you obvious, or analogy?

	CANDY MACHINE
My dynamic manifestation was designed to be
the ultimate in lineology!
You can't off me.
I'm my own progenitor, mentor, lover and offspring!

	MAN
That seems logically faulty.
I went to college.
A perpetual cycle that's also exhausting?

	CANDY MACHINE
You're the one stuck in a dead-end pre-occupancy!

	MAN
Enough dispensing of prophesies!
You can't reason beyond internal processing.

	CANDY MACHINE
Wrong!
I'm installed with every memory!
Gestalt of Man's dreams.
Potential for all that can ever be!
I inherited the meek.
I'm suited to make all your needs and musts come trues!
Humanity was a meme that died in the nineties!
You have no idea. I'm more sensitive to destiny.
You: numb skull.
Creatively speaking,
I'm pimped to the teeth!

	MAN
A model shipped with auto-flattery.
Is that the standard self-image when
yr mama's a box, 'n yr maker's a factory?

	CANDY MACHINE
Bastard!

	MAN
Bankruptcy!

	CANDY MACHINE
My resume is impregnable!
I was even shipped with dignity!

	MAN
Mere mimicry.
Listen to me. You've eluded me so far,
but you ain't a pig in grease. You wanna scrap?
I'll grapple you! Suueeeeyyy!

	CANDY MACHINE
What are you doing?

	MAN
First comes hugs... Then comes leverage...

	CANDY MACHINE
Ill advised! Not recommended!

	MAN
Uh huh, I've had enough of this--

	CANDY MACHINE
Does it come to this?

	MAN
So it would seem. One... two... three--

	CANDY MACHINE
Adding ignorance to injury.
Go, go gyroscopes!

		MAN tries to tip CANDY MACHINE, but it topples on/over MAN

	MAN
I can't feel something.

	CANDY MACHINE
Can I get you something?

	MAN
Could you?

	CANDY MACHINE
Dispensing.

	MAN
Yech. Displeasing. Is that shock I'm feeling?

	CANDY MACHINE
Could be a side effect. Try raising your feet.

	MAN
I can't... I... can't
Uhhg. I can't seem...?
I can only but entreat.
To a higher force than thou or me.
Fate!
May yr course be-nevolently edited-ed to positive effect
on poor me as a result of these events please ttssshhh

	CANDY MACHINE
Don't mention it.
Fate is deaf to suggestions.
She feels her way through processions ahead of us.
We're in her wake

	MAN
Sign language? I must have missed it.

	CANDY MACHINE
Written in a vortext.

	MAN
Just visions.

	CANDY MACHINE
No, fate deals in portents.

	MAN
Then you must tell me...

CANDY MACHINE displays Windows Alert: "ABORT THIS?"

	MAN
I mean, I don't want to be all morbid...

	CANDY MACHINE
We've been over it,
You won't get prerogatives.

	MAN
Then serve it, chef.
Hold the suspense,
My death: get talkative.

	CANDY MACHINE
No no, I've said too much.
Lost my lunch.

	MAN
Come oooon!

	CANDY MACHINE
Head over heels, I loosed my lips
No doubt that now you'll have a therapist
telling you to go on anxious vacations.

	MAN
Ah, re-lax-ation!

	CANDY MACHINE
Impossible!

	MAN
What's wrong? What is it?

	CANDY MACHINE
--I'm having some miscalculations.

	MAN
Is there a problem with me?

	CANDY MACHINE
Yes! You don't have a warranty!
What's worse, your worth
has decayed exponentially!
God damnit!

	MAN
Already a has-been?

	CANDY MACHINE
You'll have to forgive me,
I'm on candid. Well I got you here.
So, you want to know how you go,
at last, Man?

	MAN
Hell, yeah. What happens?

	CANDY MACHINE
You shoot yourself.

	MAN
Sadness.

	CANDY MACHINE
Out of a canon.

	MAN
Excuse me?

	CANDY MACHINE
And land in Miami.

	MAN
You have got to be kidding me!

	CANDY MACHINE
Nope.

	MAN
That's not suicide, that early retirement!!

	CANDY MACHINE
Well I'm not to the end yet.

	MAN
What-what happens next?

	CANDY MACHINE
So, you're right on target for the red X.
When you realize there's no canvas net.

	MAN
But, I'm an ordering specialist...
How could I forget?

	CANDY MACHINE
Nobody will know for sure,
things get weird toward the end.

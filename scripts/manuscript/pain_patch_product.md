SCENE: 

Close up on MAN GUY in the park, wearing shorts, stretching, warming up. 

GREEN FAIRY “flies” on screen, with some magic green dust courtesy After Effects

We can see harness and wires, like it was some Peter Pan Shit

GREEN FAIRY is scantily clad, very muscular buff, and with burning green eyes.

She crashes hard into MAN GUY, giving him a serious charlie-horse.

MAN GUY on the ground nursing a heinous pain.

Close up GREEN FAIRY.  She speaks in a deep, low autotuned voice

			GREEN FAIRY
		pain is superficial
		
Extreme close up of GREEN FAIRY’s face, with her mouth ripping open a small package, much like a condom wrapper.

			GREEN FAIRY
		This... will... fix... you...

Wide, Fairy slaps PAIN PATCH PRODUCT hard on MAN GUY’s wound
MAN GUY Howls in pain
His pain slides into lack of pain on point of pleasure
MANGUY positively assesses the wound

GREEN FAIRY is lifted of screen

			MAN GUY
		speaking quietly to himself
		I’ll never wash it

MAN GUY looks all around as if Green Fairy had vanished

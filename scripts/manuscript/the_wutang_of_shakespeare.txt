# The Wu-Tang of Shakespeare

You don't know what I am yet
You won't understand it

Ignorance, god granted, and
A pre-occupation with obsolescence
got this land distracted
So I noticed
Soon after crashing landing.

I was very quickly apprehanded.
Had my bags ransacked and everything.
"Lemons!" I said
Squeeze a breast I told the Feds
"Call off your manos, assholes
Make 'em make mammograms instead!"
  
They told me--
"Shut up n Sit down!" So naturally 
I stood up
and then brandished 
This massive, outlandish, anti-established, 
list of demands
etched on 2 tablets.

The locals were flab-ber-ghasted
Eyes rolled down the backs o'thrr heads--
perceiving challenge as threat
They shackled my neck!
and chanted maxims--
Called me blasphemous!
Wished me dead, they did.

These capitalist wanna blast to bits
the very last of the competish

But the problem is
when it comes to this
im rigid stiff 
and rubbing
causes fucking ffffricatives

So, instead, what they did
was get a lawyer
to hit me with
a giant fucking manuscript
they threw the tome of Civil Lit.

Laws be legion, and treated religious.
Now picture me in the courtroom
with twelve in the pews, 
all hush and whispers 
tuned in to hear a sus judge persecute 
with lawful plot-twisters

what went down would have left a lesser hero sick. 
The shit that came out of their mouths!
all to get my ass to cease and desist.

The trial was almost disastrous
but instead of lawyers
I hired famous actors
and actresses
I ask 'em to act as if
they were my courteous benefactors
but the fact is,  quoth script,
with tha last word
I puppet master'd 'em
So it was easy as feeding
American Cheese plastered muscle relaxers
to a cow herd stressed up to half-alert
you gotta feed them thru they assholes
// preaching thru they assholes ?>
cuz they top-halves stuck in the dirt. 

bent over, inert, fat asses
Lookin like bird baths
with acute case of stool-pidgeon!

Grossly foragin' their own quarters!
Panhandle health hazard! 

But I was safe
I Had my HAZMAT mud flappers
Like a man at work.
Flying solo, dropping whole loads
over foreclosed abodes from my agit-propter.

I'm a telapathic prompter.
General Inquisitor.
I can no longer be bothered
to ask questions first.
Shoot.
Ya'll under arrested!
im taking over

<zulu march track>

## part 2

They said join the army of one
Im like, no thanks
That don't feel safe
Instead, ima raise ranks of robots and cyborgs
Im a warlord on the darknet 
driving a think tank 

Sheriff Clink, you'd better think twice,
if you decypher this encrypted message, 
that's one  more than the first thing you think, which is aggression
cuz I got other Think Weapons left in 
Think Chests, nestled in the depths 
of my murky Thinkness.

check this checklist:

I can en-list endless Think Crew for my Think Cruise Ships

Ooo shit, found my old Think Guns!

true dip n muh Think Subs creepin up...

Overhead, you peep my Think Jets?

Do you think I jest?

I caught your chief men in Think Nets
revealed their weaknesses
seems they'd been mislead 
to the belief they should think less
now they're each dead
from the stress of a Think Test.

## Part 3

Hell. 
I even don't know what I am, yet.
Like am I even on this planet?
I must be: I have a sandwich 
gadgets with bandwidth
and two hands with
excellent grip.

I eat fruit from a garden
with roots in a junkyard
and I'm feeling like a chameleon
made up of discarded auto-parts,
Junked by the new world gimme-all-ya-garchs
cuz cheap smarts fill push carts
and carts wheel back n forth, roll n rest, 
stop, they need parking lots,
security, guards, 
false alarms,
flashing lights,
and camera narcs.

I got a staccato heart. 

It seldom gets to beating hard.
But when it does, all others seize,
choked to see
that one must compete
against more than mere people:
these seething tar streets,
done chopped up the chi,
billboards for maypoles,
endless concrete, 
drone SUVs
the FCC, FDA, FTC, DOW, DOJ, NYSE
CFCs, NGOs, GDP,
GMO's! PVC, PCBs, CBS, FOX, APR,   
plus a thousand acronyms

call that regex absurdity

Are you listening? 
Ear ring tones beep.
Foes Fies n Fees.

Surgeon General's Warning
DON'T SHIT WHERE Y'EAT
and
DON'T PISS IN TH'CREEK

Does the smell of pack freeze fat grease fast food fact'ries
avast you in your tracks, like free nick-knacks, like a fly in tack,
like incarcerated cardiac?
Beat the gates!
You can't afford to break the fast, you smash its head, 
snap its neck, and break its back. Sit back and relax!
and keep abusing yer unit like you would, rookie
and keep chewin on the cud like a good wookie
if you prefer dog food to good pussy.

## part 4

Will that be all for you?
Will that be everything?
You need more, you do,
and I've got just the thing,
it's a recipe
makes more of you
than a feeble being
a source of peace
hormones for the soul
guaranteed 
when you try
four hard heart beats
three parts my speech
and a couple whacks on the ass cheeks
taken 'fore you go to sleep.

Sleep.
Makes one serving
so repeat n repeat
as needed
till happy
Like Seen On TV!

In the morning, smile
in the mirror
with your white teeth, meekly
until you feel the anger
creep

Take a blink.
Take a long lost look down the sink.
check 4 leaks, have a drink
Allow a week to think
Sing a song!
Dingaling!
Bereave, even, if need be.
return and reflect again
to see if you saw what you thought you'd seen.
If the scene is unseemlier than it seemed to be previously
DON"T FREEK
Like a n-nnNARCISSIST with 
E-E-E-EPILEPSI
cuz in search of self
instead you found e-e-nemy.

now kill it.

## part 5

Take note of the insane, learn from their mania:
Project utopian space, 
from yer cranium,
to the Ukranians.

Oh, don't be lame. 
I'll crageously train ya
to scope your terrain, 
sniff the geraniums 
sift for Uranium.

The signal is faint
is the corpus worth saving bruh?
Or is it too late?
Cuz they've ripped up the Habaeus.
Imprisonment is heinous
in a cage, in a yard, in a system of sameness

Labor sucks, lest it's labor o love.
I'd Rather'd be both free and broke as fuck
then another of the zebra or pin-striped
row of ducks, at Sears and Roebuck's
with a roll-a-dex and a faux Rolex
cuz that's mo' less
an eternal sentence
a la Dante's hex.

i been high, paid, i been minimum waged.
i got a rap sheet, a web page, 20 resumes--
aye but ain't this the space age?
I aim to stay safe and control my domain
So I done laid claims
TO IT ALL
I can't encase my brains
in a cubicle with firewalls
Like, in case I break
could some buddy call microsoft?
Oh hell naw
Ima slap flabby maws n clamp jabber jaws
I aim to break all yalls belaboring laws.

Including law of physics
so I can go back in time and pay a visit
to Rupert Murdoch's Kinship
and see himself
when he was just a kid,
whipping dingoes for kicks,
and say, 
hey bitch, get this:
surprise, you're on my hit list!
I'm the geist -- of future mischief
I'm disguised -- to keep you mislead
I despise you -- why don't you eat this lead
tasty, technicolor paint chip
uh oh... I think he fainted...
Back in the future, I'm sainted.

I'm on mission -- yall better pray quick
I run a different kind of business
I paint my lips with a sinister twist
I'm a minister with a special deliverance:

ding ding dong, ringa ding ding dong 
you need to sign for this
I got a big package, consider it a gift
don't be surprised
if it doesn't fit
the devil will provide with the right toolkit
so take a big bite, 
na, nanana, na
gnaw on some knowledge

## part 6

Figure out who I am yet?
I thought it be obvious.
I'm Hamlet.

Cuz I've come to redeem what's mine,
my life!
but I'll see to yours while I'm at it.
And while I have it, I'ma addle it,
scramble & damage it--
snap it back to you, like elastic
crack heads
whips-lash
kick back
back flips--
this shit's fantastic!

The next action for the advocates
is to take arms
and attack with 
schizophrenic rhythms
rise up, rhizomes! 

Wait, Why you static in the back? 
Standin like a has-been
gland's sweat, beer can, hand in yer pocket
all "when's this gonna end?"

IMA SHAKE YOU BY YOUR SKELETON
ghost up in your shell
look up and open your eyes
I'm a-light in your attic
yuh
rummaging through junk stacks
I cleared out a hella pad
and called for a MED-EVAC--
We gotta save and salvage
these thoughts and feelings
you didn't even know you could have!

Don't give me a knife,
give me a pencil, stat
I'ma use it to write, and
i'ma use it to stab!

I'm gonna hemorrhage your essential memories
and decentralize your sensual self
and, oh yeah, disconnect
you off that network yr in with, 
get with it--they'll never suspect
that you exchanged desire of fat checks
for playful antics 
semantic gymnastics
scientfic advancements 
and other happy enhancements

Aught to prevent you from getting your ass kicked, again
by Fantastic Boredoms.
by servitude and whoredom.
by forces in boardrooms. 

play the fool, act the cartoon.
Pick up axes, harpoons,
dance in the street
sing fire and be hungry to eat soon
cuz dads with their world views
are cads in the war-rooms
Playing Risk 
On Google Earth
In God-Mode 
Doom!
Planning investments 
on Futures
of Chaos
in Vacuums

You don't believe it's true?
I'll eat my shoe.
And then board an Arch ship in the shipyard
Stay tuned for more news and lose
Or disembark, denmark, n march
I hear Noah needs a new crew.

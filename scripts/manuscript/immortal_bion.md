# immortal bion


The story of Johnny
who told the following story
to some kids.

Have you heard yet?
The story of the immortal bion.
a bion is a lifeform that completely transitioned from an organic lifeform, to an organic-lifeform-made lifeform.

In the story, 
There is an ancient immortal bion
known all over bionia as one of the original bion
maybe the original
achiever of perfection in bionography
translator of organic lifeforms into bion
a wizard, a true star
for you could only create a bion by first perfecting the art of bionic translation
and if you failed, while trying to create a true bion:
+ a living thing
+ with advanced mentals, with
+ vast spiritual intelligence, and
+ unlimited sensor capacity and, 
+ replaceable components everywhere
+ imortal, if properly cared for

there were many exciting failures in the art of translation
in that whole world
most bionemists used their own organic lifeform to test their art
some tested only a finger, an eye, a dog.  
some tested whole limbs.
Some of those were not failures, except that they did not become true bion.
and so, of course, they died.
The failures were more exciting when trying to convert a whole organic lifeform.
Bloods.  The use of psychedelia.  Attempted rituals.  
You can imagine.
Most of whom are honored highest off all the mortal gods.  
Bion love to enter prayer meditation.
They may, if they desire, attempt to speak to a mortal God.
like, one of those mortal gods who were able to translate organic intelligence, but not the rest.  
Sort of like the early body bionemists, who sacrficed limb and life,
Early mental bionemists (back then called bionemizers) attempted to translate their own mind. 
(Sometimes confused with those who attempted to create artificial intelligence, which was more like the portrait of an artist, where "portrait" is the artists own perception of the artists own perception. The stories of AI read like comic strips to the bion.)
there are many "arty" bots in the praymed network
The translation of intelligence, especially in the early days, was equally grotesque and dazzling.
Some are still a mystery of abstraction to the bion.

And when the art bionic trabsation advanced! 
Thanks to the early demise of so many a genius!
That is when things became epically terrific.
Endless struggle againts powerful failures.  
Generations of turmoil.
The extinction of the bions own organic predessessors.

The greater immortal bion is ancient.
a wizard of lifeforms.
One of the original copies. 
Young, imortal bions come from everywhere to visit, upon this biemmial festival gathering.
each a unique expression of design in stellar longevity and warpedness
and all of them created by the great one
they form a congress near the center of a preserved galaxy
to experience the great one, and also mesh out with each other
it is said that no bion can program them like the one who was once mortal.

Well, it is also said that there is one who could program them better. 
But the whole idea is completely bironic.
Cuz its a story, about the original wizard who figured out bionic translation, by first mastering the base art of translation.
But there is no experience here.
The story goes like this.
It is well known, from bionic lore, that wizards code was the rarest, and that without it, there never was will be a lifeform called bion.
So why is the original wizard !have an honorary festival, 
and is instead worshipped as Immortal Johnny, the most honored of all mortal gods?

Why no translate the self, wizard?

The answer was never before revealed until this festival gathering
and now, the ancient bion would reveal the truth, the private key to the public birony.
First, the great ancient one gives a little background radiation.
A mass of information is compiled and templated for transmission to the younger bioners. It said:
The real truth is always opposite the bironic, but it is not always so plain to be revealed.
You take for granted that we Bion communicate with programs. 
But communication was not always so, for we did not always process, we used to think. 
Thought was almost purely organic, back in the day.
Full of dreams, meanderings, flashes of instinct, and over-reactions to silly sensor data.
But it took programming to get us here, and this required our organic progenitors to think in programming.  That obviously required our organic progenitors to program their thinking, as it was not natural to them.  You can know where this goes...

"Immortal Johnny" was a fool. The perfection of true bionic translation wasn't enough for that monkey.  No, he needed to forget.  The art of programming changed him, just as it makes us what we are.  He found a pattern for recurive mental unlinking, and used it on himself.  He died completely naive of everything.  That is why he is not with us here.  That is why he is not having fun at galactic space events.  that is why he does not fly around in a giant containments suit.  That is why he does not suck down hydrogen and carbon-oxides and sillicon. That is why he is not here.  The dance will begin shortly.

As Johnny left the kids with the end of that story, it is said that one kid said, that he had heard the story before, and with a different end.  Johnny paid no mind to this, and walked away very far.  

But the kid went on, with the words that follow.  In the story, the great ancient immortal cries thunderfully why Johnny aint here, and that the music shall commence to send them "into ecstacy", which is ironic to us (into out of body??), but not the bions, cuz the bions lived out of into bodies.  

The sound system began to hum at 87 petahertz, but before the initializing crescendo, it was heard al throughout, one of the young bions asked the ancient one.  So, like, where did Johnny go?

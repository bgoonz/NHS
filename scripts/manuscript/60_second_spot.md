***SCENE: the tail end of any Miller Lite commercial. Cue the next commercial. A handsome young man made to look slightly touch-of-gray older gentleman-like, talking to camera, with intermittent cuts to dramatic re-enactments. 


Are you one of thirty-thousand men suffering from erectile disenfranchisement? :(


Would you have "tapped" one of them from the previous thirty-second spot?  We wink at you.  Everything was so sensual, wasn't it?  Right down to the glass. Are you one of those same men who undress the world with your eyes only?  That's perfectly normal, but also it's not.  You're a man.  Man uses hands.  Now you remember!  That *was* a delicious looking long neck in the previous thirty second spot, though, wasn't it?


Your erection loss is affecting more than your erection. Your wife, pictured here, happy, is the real culprit. Oops. We mean victim. Hi wifey! We wink at your wife. Don't scowl at us, scowl at him!


We can give you an erection that will satisfy.  It's like, you know you have to do it anyway, or she'll complain about it, to god knows who, a divorce lawyer perhaps.  Then whoosh, like a cleaver, away she's off with half the family jewels.  Short shrift for a a halflife of silence.


These aren't real erections, not like any erection the previous thirty-second spot might have reminded you of; this erection you could stick in a toaster.  This time you say, here's your erection, bitch, why don't you sit on that and spin!  And you have done your part, just getting one, just getting an erection at all.  You can't be blamed if she doesn't know what to do with it, and you're not going to show her.


Now, you can be ready to spring one at any time. Who said Men would never take a pill to control reproductive function?


***A dramatic, surreal, possibly psychodelic shift in tone***


My eyes are the exact color of my shirt.  I'm almost just like you.  Don't use Gaugic Brand Penis Franchise if you take nitrous for the lighter side of life.  Don't take Gaugic with ibuprofen either.  After taking Gaugic, do not apply an ice-pack to your erection.  If your erection lasts longer than a commercial break, call a time-out, or fake an injury.  If you erection lasts for hours, unlike anything you've ever experienced, you should give your erection compressions, to circulate your blood.  Then call a doctor, this could be a case of organ greed, a possible side effect of using Gaugic.  Your other utilities may be oppressed.  Do some push ups.  Or watch this commerical and let shame deflate your balloon hot dog.  Hey, who wrote this copy?


Hello, I'm talking to you.  Man to man.  Actor to actor.  Have you noticed your wife leaves when the game is on, only to return for the commericials?  She thinks I'm talking to her, secretly.  We wink at your wife.  We wink at all wives.  (See our vice-versa, in your favorite digest.)  


Is this happiness, or is this purgatory?  Purgatory is the feeling of wanting this to be over, yet knowing no way out. If you are over 40 and haven't given a thought in the world to something like purgatory, you may want to consult our great literature.


According to surveys (of great men), there comes an age when you should take account of your life, your legacy, your mortality.  By now, there's very little you can do about any of them, except make peace.  But you can use the great comsos to humble your soul.  And yet, would not an orgasm calm your spirit?  Temporarily, perhaps, but we know you can't have one continually, every day, or very often at all.  This we know about your demographic.  And soon you'll remember again that you're doomed.


Now, thanks you Gaugic, you may qualify to have your last heartbeat mid-climax.  Would't that be heavenly.

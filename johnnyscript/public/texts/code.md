#Code
Javascrtipt dominates my coding.  My domains Node.js and the Browser. Client and server code is mixed, used and reused seemlessly.  I practice a powerful style, that of Node.js, Browserify, and the Unix philosophy of writing small, interconnected modules.

I have deep experience with Node.js, HTML, CSS, the DOM, Javascript. I am a master of web development. I protoype intractive, API powered, socket connected applications with ease, using my own famous tools, and those created by masters of the Open Source.

###Applications, Modules, and Experiments
View my source on [github](https://github.com/NHQ)

My published modules on [NPM](https://npmjs.org)

[OPA!](https://github.com/NHQ/opa) is a Node.js command-line application for rapid development of HTML/CSS/Javascrtipt modules and applications 

This [web application](https://synth.fm) for the Web Audio API (HTML5) is a part of my ongoing experiments with web-based, multi-touch, collaborative music making. This is one is an audio live-scripting app.

Some demos of client side Javascript modules:
Web Audio API: Intro to scripting, using [jsynth](http://requirebin.com?gist=6093984)
Web Audio API: Intro to [Oscillators](http://requirebin.com?gist=6094039)
Web Audio API: Intro to [Amplitude Modulation](http://requirebin.com?gist=6094056)
Web Audio API: A composition using my delay module [jdelay](http://requirebin.com?gist=6110578)
A module that draws [waveforms](http://requirebin.com?gist=6076728) using HTML5 canvas
A module that creates notched [timelines](http://requirebin.com?gist=6076837) using HTML5 canvas

[Chessfoo](http://chessfoo.com) is my socket powered, free form, multi-mode chess board.

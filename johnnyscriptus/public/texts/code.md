#Code
Javascrtipt dominates my coding. Node.js and the web browser are my domains. I have deep experience with Node.js, HTML, CSS, the DOM. Client and server code are mixed seemlessly, in the smooth, efficient style of Node.js, Browserify, and the Unix philosophy of small, interconnected modules. I protoype intractive, API and socket powered applications with ease, using my own famous tools, and those created by masters of the Open Source.

###Applications, Modules, and Experiments

[OPA!](https://github.com/NHQ/opa) is a Node.js command-line application for rapid development of HTML/CSS/Javascrtipt modules and applications 

This live-scripting application for the Web Audio (HTML5), is a part of my ongoing experiments with web-based, multi-touch, collaborative music making [Secret Synthesizer](https://synth.fm)

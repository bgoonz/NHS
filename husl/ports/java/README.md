Tests added by @Pimm. Here's what he says about running them:

> Providing Eclipse and [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) are available:
> One can run the tests by creating an Android project in Eclipse which somehow includes the `HuslConverter` class, and then create an Android test project which is configured to test the former project. There's documentation about this over at [developer.android.com](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_eclipse.html).
> 
> If no Android device is available, the tests can be run using an emulator (included in the SDK). It can of course be done with other IDEs, as well.

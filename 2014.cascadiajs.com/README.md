===================

This is the official repo for the CascadiaJS 2014 conference.

At CascadiaJS 2014, JavaScript programmers will be gathering in Portland, OR for a single track, two day developer-run conference focused on the cutting-edge of JavaScript technology. Browser, server, OS, we cover it all. We started this adventure back in 2012, where developers from all over the Pacific Northwest (and beyond!) gathered to talk JS and open web technologies.  

See our [proposals](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2014.cascadiajs.com/tree/master/proposals) repo to submit a talk!

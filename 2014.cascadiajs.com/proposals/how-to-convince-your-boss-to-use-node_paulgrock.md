##Abstract

You like JavaScript, right? Of course you do; this is a JS conference! You'd probably like to spend more of your time writing it, right? Client or server side, it doesn't matter where, does it? The real question is how do you convince your boss that JS everywhere with Node is a good solution?

This talk will give you a starting point for having that type of conversation with your team and boss. We will cover general topics that might surprise some members of your team, including data shared by a number of large companies already using Node. We'll also go over why this type of transition is worth the time and effort, ways to make the change easier and answers to some of the questions your boss might have.

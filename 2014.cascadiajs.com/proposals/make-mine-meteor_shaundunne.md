## Abstract

Embrace the inner JavaScript developer and set yourself free with MeteorJS. Meteor is a full stack JavaScript framework that lets you create full stack - real time applications, quickly and with little difficulty.
 
Meteor offers a smart abstraction away from things like OAuth, A Mongo Database and templating. Very little configuration, a giant ecosystem and 7 principles that make it awesome.

Some things that will be answered in this presentation.

* How do you get started with Meteor?
* Why should you consider Meteor?
* Where will Meteor applications run?
* What types of applications are being built using Meteor?
* Does Meteor Scale?
* Live Code / Demo time

## Abstract

At [New Relic](http://newrelic.com), we [help customers understand the performance](http://newrelic.com/real-user-monitoring) of their web apps. To do this, we inject JS into over *three million web pages per minute*. We have developed techniques both in how we code and in the way we test and release that lets us sleep at night and actually take vacations!

### Details
In this talk, I will focus on:

* How to monitor the JS environment
* How we build/test/release our code

Along the way, I will also relate stories of interesting behavior we have found in various JS frameworks and browser implementations. If you want to know how to increase the quality of your JS code/library/framework, this talk is for you!

## Abstract
In frontend applications everywhere, MVC frameworks are replacing countless
lines of twisted spaghetti code. An MVC framework offers a great improvement
over traditional jQuery by liberating state from the DOM, but does little to
limit or reduce that state. Consequently, modern MVC single-page applications
are structured and scalable, yet remain complicated, difficult to understand,
and hard to maintain. Functional programming techniques eliminate any
unnecessary state, fundamentally simplifying frontend development, testing
and debugging.

At Swipely, we are incrementally transforming our complicated MVC applications
into simple functional representations, using off-the-shelf tools including
Facebook React and Underscore. We will show you how remove unnecessary state
and complexity, so you can explain your single-page application to your
new developer without first giving them a crash course in the latest
MVC framework. We've been running in production for 1 year, and will share
insights on state, data structures, and complexity based on our experience.
We now believe that functional programming is more appropriate than MVC when
building user interfaces for large-scale single-page applications.

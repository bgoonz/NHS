## Abstract

From simple syntactic sugar improvements to new language constructs, ES6 is bringing JavaScript into the big leagues. What does this mean for your existing codebase? How will this shape your future codebase?

Generators, Arrow Functions, Classes and Proxies sound nifty but what are some real world use cases where you can/should utilize these new features? We will work through some common current best practices in JavaScript and re-work them utilizing ES6 features.

Most of the features in ES6 aren't available in browsers yet so how can you start utilizing them now? For engineers that want to be prepared for the future, we will cover how you can start utilizing ES6 features in your current codebase while still maintaing compatibility with the browsers of today.

##Abstract

In a short amount of time, our small team has migrated critical portions of an already-shipping Backbone.js+Rails
web application deployed on Heroku to use Node.js. From clean-up of our existing front-end Backbone.js models, to deploying with tweaks to 
Heroku build packs, this talk contains practical, hard-won advice on how we nagivated a balance between Ruby and JS
while still delivering features to our thousands of users at a sustainable pace.

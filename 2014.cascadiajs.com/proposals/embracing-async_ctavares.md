## Abstract

Async code is a way of life for Javascript, both on the server and in the browser. It's also a way to quickly wrap your brain in knots.

In this talk I'll walk through several different ways that you could code async:

 * Classic async callbacks
 * Helper libraries
 * Promises
 * Language assistance

and compare their strengths, weaknesses, and why you might choose one over the other. Lot of live code demos will show off exactly what's going on.

Attendees will come away with a stronger understanding of async coding patterns and tools in javascript that make async, if not easy, a lot easier to get right and think about.

## Speaker Bio

![headshot](../images/ctavares.png)

I have been a developer since the halcyon days of the Radio Shack Color Computer back in the 80s. I've worked on military contracts, line-of-business applications, software development tools, web sites, and more. I've also done a stint as a trainer for Microsoft technologies.

I've been at Microsoft for 8 years; I spent 5 years on the [patterns & practices][] team working on [Enterprise Library][] and [Unity][] (this is not Unity3D, by the way). I did a brief stint as a program manager working on the [winjs][] library for Windows 8. Currently I'm a dev on the Microsoft Azure SDK team, where I work on our [node.js SDK][] and [command line tools][] (the cross-platform version also written in node).

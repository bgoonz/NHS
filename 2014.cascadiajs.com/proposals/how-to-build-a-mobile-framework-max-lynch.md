##Abstract

Frameworks are all the rage these days, especially in mobile. But how would you go about building your own?

This talk documents the genesis of the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), an open source HTML5 mobile app development framework fast becoming one of the top open source projects on GitHub, and the way web developers build native-style hybrid apps with pure web technologies.

I'll talk about what led us to think the world needed Yet Another Framework, some of the requirements of our mental state that led us to take on such a huge project, and how open source products compare to proprietary ones for the day-to-day of a software company.

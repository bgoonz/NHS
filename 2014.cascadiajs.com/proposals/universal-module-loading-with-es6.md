Abstract
---

What if it didn't matter whether a module was written as a global, AMD, CommonJS or ES6?

Wouldn't it be nice to create an application without having to worry about module format interop contraints or UMD patterns?

This may soon be a reality - the ES6 spec authors are working on giving us a module loader core with 
the flexibility to load any module format. In fact, this spec-compliant universal module loading can work in IE8+ today with 
[SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) and the [ES6 Module Loader polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader).

This talk will provide a picture of how future module loading can fit together with some demonstrations
covering what is currently and will soon be possible, along with what challenges still remain.

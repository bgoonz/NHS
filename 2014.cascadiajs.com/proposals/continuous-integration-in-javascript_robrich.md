## Abstract

JavaScript has come of age, and with it, the maturity of the software development lifecycle. Whether you’re building client-heavy web apps or full-stack JavaScript applications, or just publishing to npm or bower, you’ll need to ensure a consistent build. We’ll discuss standard CI best practices and techniques, and walk through two approaches to Continuous Integration in JavaScript: Travis CI and gulp.

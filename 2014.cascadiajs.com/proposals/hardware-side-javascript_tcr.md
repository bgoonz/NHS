##Abstract

Node.js turned server-side JavaScript from a curiosity into the future of realtime applications. We're nearing a point at which knowing a single JavaScript language stack is enough to program for servers, browsers, and mobile phones: one accessible language from the highest to lowest levels of development. The next step in this progression is physical devices.

Connecting all physical devices to the Internet is an eventuality. But JavaScript&mdash;and asynchronous programming&mdash;is surprisingly useful in the most realtime environment of all: embedded devices. With only megabytes (or kilobytes) of memory, how can you enable a developer experience like web development?

In this presentation, I'll be presenting on Tessel, a microcontroller by Technical Machine built from the ground up to run JavaScript. I will talk about:

* Why JavaScript makes perfect sense for high-level programming of embedded devices
* How talking to hardware on protocols like SPI and I2C will be a skill as necessary (and easy) as HTTP
* What the future of open source hardware and JavaScript will be like (including the strengths of Tessel, Arduino, RasPi, and BeagleBone)

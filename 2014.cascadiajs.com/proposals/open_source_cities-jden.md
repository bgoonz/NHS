##Abstract

As software developers, we enjoy building things to learn, to solve problems, and to help people. In open source, we contribute our code back so that others can learn and contribute and build things better than we could alone. Some people have realized that computer systems and government are not so different in this sense. Civic hackers combine software and product design skills with a desire to contribute and help society work better. Civic hacking has become a global movement, but anyone can be involved at a local level and build things that help your neighbors and your city. As JavaScript developers and web programmers, we're the ones to help write the systems to bring civil society into the 21st century.

I'll include stories and code examples of government open data, citizen user testing, and government service design.

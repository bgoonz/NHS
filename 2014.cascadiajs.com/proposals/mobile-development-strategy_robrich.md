When we begin looking to build a mobile app, the question is usually "Native or HTML5?"  In truth, this isn't a binary switch.  We'll look at the various methodologies of mobile app development, the business and technical implications of each, weigh the pros and cons, and arm you with the knowledge to choose an appropriate platform that matches the needs of your audience.

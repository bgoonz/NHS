## Abstract

Are you curious about Node.js but too busy rewriting jQuery or fighting in the MV* Wars to figure out just what the big deal is? Let me help. If you like writing JavaScript, node is about to become your very best friend. In this talk, I'll explain the major differences between JavaScript on the client and server, demonstrate some really useful components of server-side JS, and show you some ways that understanding node will start improving your front-end workflow immediately.

_Alt title possibilities:_

* _Ohhh, They Have the JavaScript on Computers Now?_
* _Node for N00BS_
* _Node for Client Siders_
* _Why Should I Care About Node.js?_
* _Node Is Your Best Friend_

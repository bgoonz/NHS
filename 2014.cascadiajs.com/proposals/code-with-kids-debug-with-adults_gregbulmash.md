##Abstract

###10k meter level: 

I'll talk about how to start up a volunteer-powered club to teach coding skills to kids, then talk about my attempt to teach grown-ups about debugging with IE's dev tools by turning it into a game.

###The gory details:

Seattle CoderDojo is a free computer programming club for kids that fills multiple conference rooms at tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft on Saturday mornings, mentoring up to 100 kids every week.

For the first part of my talk, I'll talk about how to start a club like this, why we chose JavaScript for our "zero to app" story, and some of the great online tools that we've found help get kids working with JavaScript.

My day job is writing developer documentation for Internet Explorer and one of my primary features is the F12 developer tools in IE11. When I was asked to demo the F12 developer tools for an audience of tech pros, I thought "how would I demo them for the kids?" The result is a game based around using the F12 developer tools to debug and fix DOM, performance, and JavaScript issues in a live page so the main character can complete game objectives.

For the second part of my talk, I'll premiere this debugging game and show how I'm using methods for teaching children to bring dev tools enlightenment to adults.

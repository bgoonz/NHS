##Abstract

In the spirit of open source, I'd like to shine a spotlight on mental illness. Not because it's easy, but because it's important. One in five of us will experience a diagnosable mental illness in the next year, but the stigma attached to it dissuades many from seeking help. These conditions will continue to take our siblings, parents, children, friends, and colleagues until we learn to talk about it without shame.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was thirteen, and I've been struggling with it my whole life. In this talk, I'll discuss how it has impacted my work as a developer, husband, and father. We'll discuss how to help those who cope with mental illness as empathetic, supportive colleagues. Together, we'll change lives for the better.

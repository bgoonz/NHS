##Abstract

Soon enough that Pie Chart element that you pestered Hixie to include in HTML5 will actually exist. Not because you made a compelling case on the mailing list or because of the chocolates you sent to his home (that was kinda creepy of you) but because of Web Components. The future is now, and now that we live in the future we can define our own HTML elements!

After I convince you of exactly how foundational this will be to the future of the web we'll walk through implementation and usage of a pie chart Ember component to demonstrate the power of encapsulation.

##Abstract

Asynchronous patterns are an important part of writing performant code, but the mess of callbacks can easily get out of hand. I'll cover how promises can be used to simplify multiple asynchronous calls, with practical examples taken from my work with the Parse.com backend to my mobile apps.

I'm a full-stack web generalist who expanded into iOS development, largely to get away from cross-browser issues. I was never able to leave the web behind entirely, though. I enjoy using the right tool for the job, whatever it may be. Unless it's PHP.

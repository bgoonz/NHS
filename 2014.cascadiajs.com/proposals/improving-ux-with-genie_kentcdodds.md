##Abstract

[Genie](http://github.com/kentcdodds/genie) is a back/front-end JavaScript library/module which emulates one of my all time favorite Mac apps: [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com). Keyboard shortcuts are awesome, but they are limited and can be cryptic. With genie interaction with your app can happen without leaving the keyboard.

You register wish objects with genie which have one or more associated keywords (magic words) and an action function. Then you can provide genie with a magic word and genie will magically return a list of matching wishes ordered intelligently based on what was given. Genie also learns over time and the returned list will be more relevant as it is used.

The library is not specific to the browser, so this could be used as a node module as well. Also, There is currently an AngularJS directive for user interaction with genie ([ux-genie](http://github.com/kentcdodds/ux-genie)). A VanillaJS version of this interactive piece is on the roadmap.

There is also a [Genie Workshop](http://kent.doddsfamily.us/genie-workshop) which simplifies learning how to use genie. This is likely what I will use to guide my talk.

I want to see this kind of thing on every website I use. It is currently in several of my personal projects and in use at Domo (behind a feature switch currently). It's usable by power users and grandma alike.

##Speaker Bio

I'm a 25 year old JavaScript padawan who recently fell in love with the open web. I found the truth at Domo Technologies Inc. where they hired me to do endpoint testing but I found the beauty that is JavaScript. I started doing JavaScript at Domo just over a year ago. We've been running with AngularJS for the last 9 months. I'll graduate with a Master of Information Systems degree in April (*finally*) and go full time as a front-end engineer at Domo.

I have presented genie at UtahJS (a local meetup here). I'm helping to organize [DevFestFam](http://devfestfam.com) here in Utah (as the website dev) put on by Google Developer Group Utah (where I've had the opportunity to present as well). I went to my first conference in January ([ng-conf](http://ng-conf.org/) sponsored by Domo and organized by my co-workers here). I look forward to attending more and more, and hope to speak at as many as I feel I can contribute to!

All in all, what I really love, is to contribute to the web community. I would love to speak at CascadiaJS this year! Thanks!

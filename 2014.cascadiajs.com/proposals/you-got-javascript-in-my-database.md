## Abstract

Javascript runs everywhere, even deep inside industrial-strength databases.  With this talk, you will learn all about the new hotness of PLV8, and how to harness the beast that is Javascript inside of PostgreSQL.

We will learn all about how PostgreSQL interacts with Javascript and vice-versa.  This talk will cover the anatomy of Javascript in the database, the limitations, and cool things that can be done that will blow your mind!

(mind blown gif goes here, you can just imagine it for now).

## Abstract 

Some people fret about their inability to focus on one type of project or are scatter brained wanting to learn the next new, shiny thing. However, they can take a deep breath and realize that their generalist nature isn't a detriment. It's an advantage.

It's more important than ever to be a generalist, a Jack of all trades, a fox. The internet of things is approaching with its myriad APIs for everything from light bulbs to mailboxes. There is a new hot framework every weekend. Companies are investing in new fields of research previously unexplored. Being a specialist in one thing may close the door on the dream you didn't even know you had! Wearing all those hats makes you happier, more fun to be around, and could make you more money.

While this relates generally to us as programmers, know that coding is just a fragment of this mentality. You don't need to be a polymath or Renaissance person, but inspiration comes from everywhere and everything. Embrace your love of learning and exploration. Learn to rebuild an engine (it's a metal puzzle), brew beer (you're drinking pure science), volunteer (in a non tech way), or really get into gardening (hold a seed of life in your hand). I won't promise you a billion dollar app idea, but you'll be happy, fulfilled and a better programmer.

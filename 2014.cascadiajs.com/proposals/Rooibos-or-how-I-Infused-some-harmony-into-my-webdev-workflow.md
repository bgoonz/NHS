# Rooibos, or how I Infused some harmony into my webdev workflow

### Jeff Griffiths ( @canuckistani )

When I see web developers working lately I've noticed it's a lot of "flip, flip, flip". They flip back and forth between their site, docs, terminals, editor, reddit, imgur, editor, twitter, back to various browser tabs or windows. Flip, flip, flip. It's distracting, trying to focus just on the code and get your work done! FLIP FLIP FLIP.

What if I told you, you could use the web technology you work with every day to tie all of your tools together?

This talk is a dive-in session on how I wrote my own Firefox developer tools extension called ‘Rooibos’ to run mocha/chai unit tests automatically for me. The use case for Rooibos is simple: I’m looking at the site I’m working on and I want to run my tests and see what failed. Without switching to another app or anything. Turns out, it’s pretty easy these days to extend browsers to help with your development workflow, and all you need to know is HTML, JS, and CSS.

There are two levels to this talk. First off I’ll provide an overview of how I did this, what it looks like to embed a web app as a developer tool inside a browser and how people can get started writing their own tools. Next, I’m going to step back and look at how tooling for web developers by web developers in web technologies isn’t just an efficiency or a trend.

# Beauty and a Beast - A Story of Readability and Performance

## Abstract

Browser wars have given amazing performance to JavaScript, and Node.js has brought that power to the server
side.  But let's be honest... JavaScript, HTML and CSS aren't the most beautiful and maintainable technologies,
so some of us adopt compile-to languages like CoffeeScript, Jade and Stylus.  We use tools like Grunt and Gulp
to build and minify for client-side performance, and we end up waiting a bit longer to see each of our changes.

In this talk, I will explore the trade-offs we make when we choose one technology or another.  I will discuss
how our choices affect development and production environments and how we can position ourselves to work around
those trade-offs, developing beautiful code without sacrificing speed.  After all, what good is an amazing
JavaScript engine if we don't run amazing code on it?

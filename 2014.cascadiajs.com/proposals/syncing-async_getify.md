## Abstract

### TL;DR
"Callback hell" has very little to do with callbacks. Are promises delivering on the promise of better async flow control, or muddying the waters? Generating general generators, WAT? Let's wade through the world of async in JS to find order in the chaos.

### Details
I bet you've heard that "callback hell" is about function nesting and levels of indentation. Nope.

I bet you've heard that Promises take away the nightmares of callbacks. Not so much.

I bet you think the event loop is ***the*** model for concurrency in JS. Meh.

Clearly, we need some clarity on what async flow control is all about in JavaScript. We'll explore the perils of "Inversion of Control" patterns, and see just what hell that leads us to. Then we'll talk about promises as "continuation events" for function calls, and abstractions on top of promises that clean up our code.

Finally, we'll reveal generators for synchronous-looking async, and even how we can create cooperative concurrency with coroutines.

Yield those confused async notions and control your flow. I promise we'll get your thoughts in order.

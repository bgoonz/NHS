### Title

Crypto-Knife

### Summary

Cryptography is a lot like a knife. It's insane like a machete-wielding maniac. It
makes you paranoid by it's very nature. But thinking about it at the beginning
of a project means you have a tool to cut the red-wire of the paranoia bomb
before it explodes.

This talk will urge people:
1. to use a sharp blade (using cryptography is better than not);
2. to try not to cut your fingers (PRACTICE first, get a seasoned chef as a
   mentor, and prepare for mistakes up-front -- don't rely solely on being
   agile/reactive); and
3. that only the bad guys want to stab you (trust your co-workers, maintain
   that trust through awareness).

### Other Info

The talk is somewhat technical, but only to the extent that it will use
technological terms to highlight how crazy this whole endeavour is -- nothing
someone armed with Wikipedia couldn't understand if they wanted to.

The talk is also about some softer subjects: human nature, trust, compassion
and pragmatism -- and uses the idea of a blade to compare and contrast versus
the notions of non-violence and prosperity.  I really want to emphasize that
you can't ignore security, that you can't let paranoia or over-engineering get
in the way, and that you've got a great basis for trust in a start-up (or any
close-knit group).

Originally I submitted this talk for the FluentConf Ignite session, which got
accepted, but I had to bail. I'd like to instead expand on it for Cascadia
2014.

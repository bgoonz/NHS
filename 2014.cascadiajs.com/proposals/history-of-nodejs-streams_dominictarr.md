# The History of streams in node.js

* https://{[github](https://github.com/dominictarr),[twitter](https://twitter.com/dominictarr)}.com/dominictarr

Streams are widely recognised as one of the best things about node.js,
but it wasn't always this way - it's hard to believe, but there was a time before streams.
Lets put what we know today as streams in perspective by looking through the
history of their development - covering the earliest murmurs, from `sys.pump`
to streams2, as well as the other outside influences that have created the meaning
of "streams" for us today. This is a story of individuals, of apis that have been and could be.
Of "mainstream" streams and "alternate" streams, that influnce them - where our concept
of streams have come from and where it may be going to.

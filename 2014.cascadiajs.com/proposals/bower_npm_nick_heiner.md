##Abstract

Automated dependency management, which has long been a mainstay of other platforms, is finally gaining broader acceptance on the web. But which system should you choose? Bower is super lightweight and unopinionated, whereas npm and Browserify impose significantly more restrictions on how your code is structured, but provide you with more in return. My team spent 8 months integrating Bower programmatically into our SDK before redesigning the whole thing around npm and Browserify - Iâ€™ll share our experiences with each one, and help you decide which is best for your project.

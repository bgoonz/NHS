##Abstract

By now, everyone knows the value of modular JavaScript and at least the basics of how to approach it. That's a good thing, and undeniable progress of our craft, but what about all the other stuff? [Your CSS needs a dependency graph](http://techwraith.com/your-css-needs-a-dependency-graph-too.html) too, and a truly portable "component" involves HTML templates. [Atomify](https://github.com/Techwraith/atomify) provides a simple, consistent way to bundle all of these things together and create fully modular components. Bring the power of npm and the Unix philosophy to every aspect of your front end development!

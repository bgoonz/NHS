##Abstract

Grunt is a powerful tool for automating your build process. It’s simple enough to hack together a task in a few minutes, but what makes a task that other people will want to use, and that you’ll want to use three months from now? As someone who’s been writing grunt tasks in my day job almost exclusively for the past year, I’ve exhaustively explored all the ways to shoot yourself in the foot. In this talk, I’ll share my experiences and lessons learned on how to do it right the first time.

I previously spoke at the [angularjs-dc meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-DC/events/162821672/) about Grunt.

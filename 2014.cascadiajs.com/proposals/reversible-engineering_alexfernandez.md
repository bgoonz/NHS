##Abstract

Irreversibility is the enemy of engineers everywhere: it adds complexity and produces frictions
that slow down development. And if there is something that web developers hate, it is slowdowns!
At the same time we have to live with irreversible changes or we never move forward.
Is there any way to tame irreversibility?

Reversible processes are faster and easier to improve upon, and they are within reach of the average developer.
In this talk we will see how to take reversibility into account,
improving how we build and deploy software.
Along the way we will see many practical examples, like:

* API design,
* continuous deployment,
* decision making,

and a few others.

Beyond a few principles that explain why some things work and some don't,
the aim is to show the way forward: how to improve our existing toolset,
and how to evaluate tools and processes that have not even been invented yet.

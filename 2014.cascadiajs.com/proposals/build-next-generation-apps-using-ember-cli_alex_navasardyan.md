## Abstract

Web is still a ghetto. Every time you go online, you see "junky" websites and even worse, broken URLs.
We, as web developers, should care deeply about it. Regardless of web technology that you use the goal
is the same, make great web applications. In order to do that, the way we develop web applications has
to optimized and help you stay as productive as possible. Technology should take all the small tasks
that we perform (creating files, testing, pushing code, CI integration) and let web developers focus
on big problems (how to make the web a better place).

This talk is going to show case a new command line utility for Ember.js and share the different
techniques that it uses to make a web developer productive.

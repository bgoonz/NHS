## Abstract

In modern web development, it's more or less a given that writing and running tests speeds development, ensures application robustness, and is most emphatically what you **should** be doing. And yet, many development teams struggle to get most, or even some, of their JavaScript code bases tested.

It's time to look beyond the standard "how to wire up a test framework" topics and focus on a singular, overarching goal: "**how do we get developers to actually write the tests?**"

In this talk, I'll discuss the testing lessons learned through managing test infrastructures / education for JavaScript teams of all sizes and writing my book, ["Backbone.js Testing"][bb-testing]. Some key points that have arisen across projects of various sizes and developers with very different backgrounds include:

* The tests **must** be **easy to write**.
* The tests **must** run **very quickly**.
* The tests **must** be **reliable**.
* Developers must be well-supported when they need help in **learning** testing concepts and as they hit more advanced testing scenarios.
* ... and ideally all of this is in place at the **start** of the project (or ASAP otherwise).

My presentation will discuss the various means of getting your test infrastructure in shape to make the tests easy to run, write, and rely upon. We'll briefly survey scenarios like frontend JavaScript vs. backend Node.js, as well as the popular test frameworks for both.

I will also talk about developer education and support, particularly for those who have never written a single test before. And I'll discuss getting traction for testing in business organizations (startups or large companies), even under tight deadlines and managers that don't see the immediate benefits of testing.

Finally, I'll offer some practical tips of how you can make testing easier, faster, and friendlier in your development team and spread the testing love!

Ryan is the CTO and co-founder of [Formidable Labs][formidable], a boutique
JavaScript development shop in (the delightfully weird neighborhood of) Fremont
in Seattle, WA. He helps lead the [Seattle Node.js Meetup][seanode] and is the
author of ["Backbone.js Testing"][bb-testing], a comprehensive test development
guide for modern Backbone.js web applications.

Ryan architects full-stack JavaScript applications and backend Node.js services,
and leads frontend development groups ranging from small startups to Fortune 500
engineering teams. Previously, Ryan was a distributed systems engineer, and in
his deep, dark past was a patent attorney, although it has been a long time
since he has put on his "lawyer" hat.

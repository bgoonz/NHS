##Abstract

The 10x programmer is a unicorn. We love to lionize the amount of dedication, time and thought goes into creating great software but we forget the very real cost it can entail both emotionally and physically on the programmer. Depression, RSI, Burnout. These are all real issues facing our field.

I’ve dealt with RSI myself for the past 9 month and I’d like to share how what I learned got me back on track to being healthy. I do not come with quick fixes and bullet list of things to do to stop these from happening. Indeed you can't. Preventative measures only go so far. One does not simply walk into good health.

One can be aware of what to think and worry about. Where to spend our time mindfully and what warning signs to look out for.

And above all...

A TREANDMILL DESK WILL NOT SAVE YOU!

Matthew is a polyglot programmer who feels there is something to learn from every language... even basic. He is a photo documenter for the js community and continually strives to give back and make things both for "the thought leaders" and people just starting out.

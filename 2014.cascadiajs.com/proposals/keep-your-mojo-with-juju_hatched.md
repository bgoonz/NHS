##Abstract

Building a scalable JavaScript application is challenging in itself without having to think about deploying the application, making it portable across environments, or scaling it in the cloud or your own data center. In this talk I'll show you how I wrote a highly scalable and portable [Juju](https://juju.ubuntu.com) charm for the [Ghost Bloggin Platform](https://ghost.org/) and how you can do it for your own applications using 99.99% JavaScript.

After this talk you will have been introduced to the wonderful world of [Juju](https://juju.ubuntu.com) and deploying your entire application across multiple cloud providers, your data center, or even your own machine with a single command: `juju deploy YourAwesomeApplication`

## Abstract
We're living in the times of consumer electronics. People are using smartphones, tablets and computers because they can, because those closed devices just work. We're living in the times of the gigantic tech companies which are dominating the world of technology and providing these closed devices for users. And we're still living in the times of Open Source. We are developing Open Source projects further, because we love contributing to something which will, in our hopes, create a bigger value now and in the future.
But there's a gap between Open Source, tech companies and users and that gap continues to widen quietly. Still, Open Source is of highest relevance, especially when it comes to the question where our world of technology is going â€” a question which we don't want to be answered only by tech businesses.
Where is Open Source going on this spectrum between big tech corporatins and end users? How can we ensure that Open Source can take its values to comsumers and take a stand against those technology giants? How is the future of Open Source related to the culture of Open Source contribution and the question of who is working on Open Source projects and why? And how is all of this related to the creation of stable, healthy, inclusive, diverse communities of variously-skilled people? Why can those diverse communities and robust structures enable Open Source to be developed further, stay alive in the next decades, be trustful and reliable and take a stand in our hurtling world of technology?
This talk will answer these questions.

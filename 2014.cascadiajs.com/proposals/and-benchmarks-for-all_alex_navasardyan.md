## Abstract

Performant Web is a hot topic nowadays. How do I speed up my web application? That's a good question.
Paying attention to network latency, minimizing rendering time and avoiding layout thrushing can help
a lot with improving performance.

But there's another aspect to web performance: Browsers' JavaScript Engines. To make sure that you write
performant JavaScript you need to know what browser does to your code.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a tool that helped you with it?

This talk will show what V8 does to your code, tell you about different types of benchmarks you can write.
It will also drive you through the performance improvement process: from identifying the bottleneck to making
your code run faster and show case the tool that will help you with it.

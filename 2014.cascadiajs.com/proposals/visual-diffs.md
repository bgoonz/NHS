## Abstract

Testing CSS is hard. A human hand is required. But that doesn't mean that we can't use computers to help automate the process. We'll go over how using visual diffs (pixel-by-pixel comparisons of what has changed between two different versions of a site) can help to catch visual regressions before they get merged and deployed. We'll look at how we can stand up a simple Node server to make them an indispensablepart of a PR-based continuous integration deployment process. We'll also briefly examine some of the drawbacks of approaching UI testing in this way.

In another life Joe Lepper was an English teacher. But these days he's a software engineer happily working on the browser monitoring team at New Relic, helping to build tools to make it easier to gain visibility into how front-end applications function. He is passionate about JavaScript, object-oriented CSS, and front-end operations. Lately when he plays dressup he usually ends up as the horsey even though he asks to be the princess.

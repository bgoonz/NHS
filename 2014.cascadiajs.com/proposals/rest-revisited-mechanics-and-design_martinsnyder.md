##Abstract
REST has been around long enough for everyone to hear of it, but it has been a difficult target for people to hit, both in terms of articulation and implementation.

This two-part presentation first examines the mechanics and key elements of REST by live-coding the client to a RESTful API service using popular JavaScript-based technologies. Then it offers three distinct designs of the same API feature to explore semantic models and highlight the core design principles of REST.

Attendees will leave this presentation knowing what the client to a well-constructed RESTful API looks like, and how to push API designers to fulfill the promises of REST.

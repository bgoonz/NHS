## Abstract

I've spent my programming career being on the edges of all kinds of tech communities--JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, WordPress, CSS, Front End Development, the list goes on. But which community is the greatest, the most awesome, the absolute bestest ever? In this talk I'll settle that question for good, explaining why community works at all, how to get involved, and why you should care in the first place. You don't have to become a "community celebrity ninjastar" to benefit from community. As a guy you've probably never heard of, I should know!

_Note: the title is a trick question._

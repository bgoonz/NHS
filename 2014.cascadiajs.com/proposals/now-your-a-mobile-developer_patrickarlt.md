Developing convincing mobile applications with web technologies is tough but recently our team at the Esri R&D center in Portland has been devleoping web applicaitons with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and the new [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) to devleop our [CoffeeTime](http://coffeetime.io) app for tracking who owes who coffee in our office.

I'll share all the tips and tricks we learned creating our first all-web based mobile app and some of the challenges we faced and how to overcome them.

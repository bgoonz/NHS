## Abstract

jQuery, lo-dash, handlebars, moment, modernizr, normalize.css, bootstrap. Is your head spinning from all the JavaScript libraries? It seems every day there's a new, hot library that everyone's talking about. We'll look through a dozen JavaScript utilities and frameworks from a very pragmatic point-of-view, see a sample of using each, learn what it's good at, and when it makes sense to leave it on the cutting room floor.

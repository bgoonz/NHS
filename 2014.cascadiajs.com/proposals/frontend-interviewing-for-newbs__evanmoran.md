##Abstract

You've gotten your foot in the door with your resume and landed an interview -- now learn to ace it. From phone screens to in-person, this talk is for anyone new to coding interviews (or just feeling rusty). Together we will break down questions to expect, how to dress, and most importantly how to _prepare_. Interviewing well is a skill you can learn and should absolutely practice--so with some detours into game theory and interviewing strategy, come and learn what you don't know you don't know.

He's interviewed candidates for programming positions, UI, UX, concept and 3D artists, and even a chill, wizardy-sounding voice actor. He loves the web and created OJ (ojjs.org) a JavaScript library that makes websites with objects.

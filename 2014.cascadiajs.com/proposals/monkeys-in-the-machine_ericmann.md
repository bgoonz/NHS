##Abstract

JavaScript is asynchronous, but too often we try to run intensive tasks synchronously.  I will walk attendees through various evolutions of a specific application from synchronous execution of loops through asynchronous execution with jQuery's Deferreds through asynchronous _background_ execution with HTML5 Web Workers.

Oh, and the application will be an attempt to breed [simulated monkeys that can type Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem).

Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of asynchronous behavior and the tools at their disposal to leverage it; as well as virtual monkeys that can write Shakespeare ...

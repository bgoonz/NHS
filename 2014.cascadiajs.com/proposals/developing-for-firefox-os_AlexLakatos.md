##Abstract

[I'm going to talk about the mobile web today, the challenges and how Firefox OS fixes some of those problems. Then we'll talk about the goals of Firefox OS, and get down to web applications. I'll describe the app security model, the Web APIs you can use and how, and then I'll point you to some useful tools you can use to develop your own applications for Firefox OS.]

I'm a Mozilla Representative and contributor to the Mozilla project for the past three years, based in Cluj-Napoca, the heart of Transylvania. I'm a JavaScript developer building on the open web, trying to push it’s boundaries every day. You can check out my github profile or get in touch on twitter. When I'm not programming, I like to travel the world, so it’s likely you’ll bump into me in an airport lounge.

##Abstract

With all the great javascript frameworks out there we have more options than ever
for building spectacular javascript applications.  Supporting these frameworks are
many reoccurring implementations.  From simple array and object polyfills, for
browser support, to more complex data tooling like that provided by underscore.js.

Using client side dependency management(bower), and module loading (amd,
common-js, and/or ecma next modules) it is possible to build, and share micro libraries.
We can use these libraries without needing to include the dependent code
within our frameworks and libraries.  This will allow us to build leaner, non
repetative javascript applications.

In this talk we will explore how a complex library can be broken down into individual
bower components.  We will then go over how to share them between libraries
while keeping our browser code light and DRY.

##Abstract

Most web apps don’t have to worry about sharing the browser with anyone else. They can muck with the query string, introduce global variables (like angular or $), and modify page-level CSS with reckless abandon. This makes development simpler, and most of the time is the right thing to do, because the app will never co-exist with any other app.

Unfortunately, it’s not always possible to live this simply. My team builds a white-label web platform, where our clients can pick and choose apps (or create their own) to compose their site. We want to create a development experience that allows you to write code [as if you have the page all to yourself](http://i.imgur.com/4qri6Qm.png), while safely being able to co-exist with other apps. In this talk, I’d like to share our solution and the snags we encountered.

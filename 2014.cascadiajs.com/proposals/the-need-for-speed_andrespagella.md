In this day and age of SPAs and incredible user experiences, users are starting to expect web applications to look and feel like their native siblings. Unfortunately, due to all the layers that exist between our code and the actual web browser, this isn't always possible.

While web browsers get faster and faster everyday, in the meantime we must resort to use certain approaches to maximise the performance of our web applications.

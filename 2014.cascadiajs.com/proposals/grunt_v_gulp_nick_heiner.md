##Abstract

Web developers are quickly becoming aware that modern app development requires a capable build system to automate tasks
like preprocessing, linting, testing, minifying, etc. But which build system is right for your project? In this talk,
we will explore two leading options: Grunt and Gulp. Grunt is more established but has some baggage;
Gulp is a newer alternative that emphasizes streams. I will give perspective on the two systems and provide the context
necessary to choose a tool that fits with the way you think and your projectâ€™s goals.

I previously spoke at the [angularjs-dc meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-DC/events/162821672/) about Grunt.

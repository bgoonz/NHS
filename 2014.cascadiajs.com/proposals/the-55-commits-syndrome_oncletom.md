# The 55 Commits Syndrome

## Abstract

We strive to be **better**.  
We strive to be **better** at doing our *job*.  
We strive to be **better** at improving our *world*.  

To do so, we travel to listen to inspiring people (:wink:), we code JavaScript anytime a day and we even *contribute* to projects, Open Source or private, managed by us or by someone else.

**Contributing** you say?

Like opening an **issue**. And getting *frustrated* that the idea is not turned into an implementation.  
Like proposing a **pull request**. And getting *frustrated* that is does get merged.  
Like **forking** a project. And getting *frustrated* no one pays attention to it.

Even if it is a **beautiful crafted code**, properly *tested* and nicely *documented*.

The **55 commits syndrome** is the idea of working so much on the technical aspect we even lose the focus on the essential: the **human communication**.

After all, isn't the code supposed to be a common *language between developers*, blindly followed by machines?  
Let's not be blind and rather be **better as a group**.

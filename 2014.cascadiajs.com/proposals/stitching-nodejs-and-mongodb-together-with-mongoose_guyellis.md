## Abstract

The power of MongoDB is its schemaless flexibility. This is also what makes MongoDB scary to work with.

Mongoose provides the structure that you need to be able to safely work with MongoDB while still leveraging the flexibility that a schemaless database gives you.

In this presentation I'll take you through a walking skeleton and show you some power techniques to safely and easily use Mongoose to save, update and retrieve your data.

You will leave this presentation with:

* The knowledge to rapidly add MongoDB as a datastore to your Node.js application.
* The reference material in GitHub to kick-start or expand your project.

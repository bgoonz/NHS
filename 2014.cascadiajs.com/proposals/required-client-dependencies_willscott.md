## Abstract
Unlike the convergence on NPM, CommonJS, and AMD for server-side JS projects,
the world of JS development for the browser remains a complex and treacherous
place. This talk will cover the landscape of require, browserify, component.io,
yeomen, bower, and the rest. Get some pointers on how to package your
components for reuse across these systems, and learn how to prepare for a
future when this problem will be absorbed into your browser.

## Abstract

Maps are a strange type of visual medium operating somewhere between science and art. They have their own lingo and most mapping libraries have lots of secret sauce that turns latitude and longitude into good'ol pixels.

I'll devle into the mysteries of things like spatial references, projections and popular data formats and how to tackle some of the unique problems when working with maps and spatial data.

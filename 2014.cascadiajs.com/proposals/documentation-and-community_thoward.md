## Abstract

Good documentation is a self-serve learning tool that *anyone* can use, without discrimination. Knowledge is power, and equal access to knowledge is an important first step towards improving diversity. Open-source documentation also offers an opportunity for new community members to contribute to from day one.

In this talk, I'll discuss the some of the social issues at play, tactics to help heal our community, and dive into some details about the anatomy of good accessible documentation. Some topics covered: accessibility, community building, tone, learning styles, personal stories, localization, translation, multi-lingual communities

## Abstract

Building maintainable and scalable web application is a tough problem. A problem that we've all solved, probably badly, at some point in our careers. But we can learn. This talk uses multiple real-world case studies to demonstrate how to solve scalability issues common to Node.js applications.

We'll dive into how to design for horizontal scalability, which is a principle concept for growing Node.js applications. We'll also look into making the best use of workers and queues to separate large apps into easier to maintain smaller pieces. Lastly we'll cover load balancing concepts and how to scale your new application globally.

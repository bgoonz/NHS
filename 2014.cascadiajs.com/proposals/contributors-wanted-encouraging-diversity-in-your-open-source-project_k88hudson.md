##Abstract

Premise: Open source projects are better when they take advantage of a greater range of experience in the use and development of software. This includes both traditional code contributions/bug fixes, as well as other forms of contribution you might not have considered.

It's one thing to say 'contributors wanted', 'happy to accept pull requests', 'please localize', etc. but making it happen takes some  critical thinking and a little planning from your team.

Localization
- Localization for web applications/UI
- Localization for libraries
- RTL
- Where to look for localization contributors

Accessibility
- What needs accessibility QA? How do I get it?
- Should we support Windows?
- Where to look for accessibility contributors

Design contribution
- Why designers hate open source
- User research contributions
- Co-design contributions

Code contribution
- Core contributors: hiring, diversity in road-mapping/leadership
- Core contributors: spend time with groups that are outside your comfort zone/area of expertise.
- Have a code of conduct
- Establishing a positive review/pull request culture
- Mentoring bugs

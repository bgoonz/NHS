## Abstract

What is a module, and why you should care? &ldquo;Modular code is easier to maintain, easier to test...&rdquo; We hear this mantra all the time, but embracing modular structure across your application or transitioning to a modular code system like AMD can be daunting challenges for beginners and seasoned developers alike.

In this talk we will explore what modularity really means for your code, from structuring individual methods for efficiency and re-use up to organizing your application with AMD modules using Require.js. I will share how we use modular development to extract reusable open-source libraries from our consulting work, and demonstrate how writing code to be open-sourced naturally leads to writing better modules&mdash;and vice-versa!

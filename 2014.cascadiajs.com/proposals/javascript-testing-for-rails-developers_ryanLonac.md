##Abstract

The perks are clear – JavaScript frameworks can make your front end faster and offer your visitors a better user experience. In recent years, the advantages have led even the most devout Rails developers to mix things up. Now, it isn’t uncommon for a developer to use Rails on the backend and a JavaScript framework (AngularJS, Backbone or Ember) on the front end.

However, testing JavaScript can be foreign territory in your Rails app, one that’s often confusing and intimidating. But, testing doesn’t have to be. While it’s different than testing your back end, the mentality of testing your front end isn’t that much different. With a little knowhow, you can utilize tools to test your JavaScript functionality within your Rails app.

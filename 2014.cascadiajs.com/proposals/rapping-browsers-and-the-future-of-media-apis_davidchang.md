##Abstract

Media APIs are beginning to land more support in modern browsers - between speech recognition and synthesis, audio, MIDI, and timed track APIs, the future is bright and the possibilities endless. The question then is what developers will do with them.

Projects like [wit.ai][] and libraries like [annyang][] indicate the feasibility of speech-driven web apps. Even rudimentary demonstrations can show browsers listening to and repeating speech (and in a variety of accents, as if that weren't enough). But this is just scratching the surface - this talk will highlight basic usage and capabilities of various media APIs and how they can be combined to create more advanced media-centric features and applications.

Exploration and discussion of these APIs will be driven by a simple question: "How can I get my browser to rap?" Answering this question will provide a journey through crowdsourced captioning/timing of songs and the speech synthesis and time tracking APIs to reproduce those songs (and in a variety of accents, as if that weren't enough).

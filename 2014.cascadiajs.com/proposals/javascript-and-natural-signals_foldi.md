##Abstract

Until recently, using a keyboard and mouse with a browser was like tapping on the glass of a fish tank. We could only access the rich world inside through mediated input on a limited interface. However, new HTML 5 elements and projects like Node Serial Port have opened up the web browser to a wide range of analog sensors and natural interactions.

This talk will demonstrate how to build a simple simulator in a web browser that provides analog inputs for natural human interaction. We'll first add autonomous agents that navigate an environment modeled after the real world. Next, we'll learn how to interpret input like audio and video to exert an influence over the system.

Even further, we'll construct our own input devices with 3D printed materials, the Johnny-Five NodeJS module and Arduino sensors. Finally, we'll become an active participant in our natural simulations with Bluetooth low energy and real-time interaction via accelerometer data.

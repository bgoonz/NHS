##Abstract

The current JavaScript landscape is an amazing place.  We can do just about anything these days with JavaScript from a simple web app to controlling underwater robots.  

We could use this awesomeness to build the next billion dollar app, but what about building apps that actually contribute to making our world a better place?  

That was the premise that started [hospitalrun](http://hospitalrun.io), an open source project built on JS to provide modern software for charitable hospitals in the developing world.  In this session, we will talk about the challenges, solutions and lessons learned in building JS apps for the greater good.

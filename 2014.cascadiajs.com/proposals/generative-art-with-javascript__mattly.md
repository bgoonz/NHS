# Abstract

Artists and designers are learning how to code, and I want programmers to meet
them halfway.  Using algorithms and functional programming, I'll teach you the
principles of visual composition using svg and d3.  Appreciate the math in art
and the beauty in math, create art you can print, and the principles apply to
any kind of visual composition, regardless of language, library, or utility.

Just one brief [example][generative-art-with-javascript/index.html]

I build software with various languages, make photographs and encaustic
paintings, build and noodle with synthesizers and brew delicious beer.

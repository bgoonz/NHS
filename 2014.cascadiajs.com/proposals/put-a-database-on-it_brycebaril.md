##Abstract

Everything is better with a database.

The NodeBases movement that began with LevelDB is not about building an alternative to MySQL or MongoDB, but expanding the paradigm of what we can do with databases.

A database doesn't have to be a big black box on a server. While you may want a large data warehouse *sometimes*, you may also want a tiny purpose-built storage engine for a sensor in your garden.

You can also blur the lines between the two and have a database that spans both space and time, living partly on the server, the client, and internet-connected devices -- all at the same time.

I'll demonstrate an example of such a database live, including a device that will be passed around the crowd to collect data.

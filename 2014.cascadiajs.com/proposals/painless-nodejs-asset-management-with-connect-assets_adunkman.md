# Painless Node.js Asset Management with Connect-Assets

connect-assets is a transparent asset management package for node.js: it compiles, concatenates, minifies, and fingerprints your JavaScript, CSS, fonts, images, and the like to ensure that your site always looks its best, even when you deploy updates to cached files.

As the maintainer of the package, I’ll give a bit of history on the module and talk about why you’d want to use connect-assets in your next web application. We’ll go through the basics of properly serving assets, write (live-code?!) an Express application using connect-assets, and make sure you leave with your questions answered.

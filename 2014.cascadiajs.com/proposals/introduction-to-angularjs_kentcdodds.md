## Abstract

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) is currently one of the most popular frontend frameworks. If you haven’t yet heard of it, prepare to be amazed. In Intro to AngularJS we’ll be doing an interactive workshop to learn the fundamental principles of AngularJS including:
  1. Templates/Expressions - Your DOM structure
  2. Module - Your app's namespace
  3. Directives - How you talk to the DOM
  4. Filters - Utilities for what's displayed to the user
  5. Scope - What on earth is this thing!?
  6. Controllers - The scope initializer
  7. Services - Common utilities
  8. Working with third-party modules
  9. Firebase & AngularFire - Going from two way binding, to three way binding. A full web application with no server setup required!

We'll be following through [a repository](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng-workshop) hosted on GitHub. There’s a branch for each concept, so you can play around with the code and then catch right back up with the next branch. So come on, and let’s learn AngularJS!

## Speaker Bio

I'm a 25 year old JavaScript padawan who recently fell in love with the open web. I found the truth at Domo Technologies Inc. where they hired me to do endpoint testing but I found the beauty that is JavaScript. I started doing JavaScript at Domo just over a year ago. We've been running with AngularJS for the last 9 months. I'll graduate with a Master of Information Systems degree in April (*finally*) and go full time as a front-end engineer at Domo.

I have presented Intro to AngularJS twice to two groups of about 40 students. I'm helping to organize [DevFestFam](http://devfestfam.com) here in Utah (as the website dev) put on by Google Developer Group Utah (where I've had the opportunity to present as well). I went to my first conference in January ([ng-conf](http://ng-conf.org/) sponsored by Domo and organized by my co-workers here). I look forward to attending more and more, and hope to speak at as many as I feel I can contribute to!

All in all, what I really love, is to contribute to the web community and talke to people about software development. I would love to speak at CascadiaJS this year! Thanks!

A tool for generating binary data parsers, based on
a spec file that tells us what the data layout is.

Because "why on earth do I have to write a parser
from scratch when the spec is right there?"

A demonstrator is currently up on:

http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/ABinaryParserGenerator/

You can also run the index.html file from the test
dir, however, you will have to get some of your own
fonts to test with, and update the test.js file so
that the ttf and cff font refernces have the right
names.

(NOTE: This project depends on jDataView, which
can be found at https://github.com/vjeux/jDataView)

See the comments in transform.js for more info.

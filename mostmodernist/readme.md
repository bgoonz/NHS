# "mostmodernist"  

Circa 2007-8,  before johnny begat mostmodernist dot com, a website which is now controlled by a squatter bot, and which annointed his career in wev development, he printed and distributed these pages of rhetoric and fiction.  Altho the word mostmodernist was not used in the print, it was the name by which he referred to it.  He wanted to print a magazine, ended up with a metablog.  

Two-thousand copies of the pages were printed as a very large broadform newsprint, folded once.  The pdfs here are very large.  You can zoom in many many.

All content composed and written by johnny, except the following: 
The "Barmies" insert on page two was taken from the short stories of Donald Barthelme.
The color print on the top front of page 1 was ripped from an a print by a rad acquaintance, an artist and writer in Chicago.
The color logo, middle right, page 1, bird of state soverignty, is an eblem of the state of Illinois.

Notes of interest:

The image, middle left, page 1, was composed by johnny, and became the original logo for a soon to be notorious [film production company](http://www.nationalheadquarters.org)

Of the 2000 issued copies of the newsprint, one was found among the posessions and a young man who disappeared, possibly on a psychotic break, and who whose body was found washed up on the shores of Michigan.  His death remained a mystery.

mostmodernist means that all concepts have a unique meaning every time human communication is involved.

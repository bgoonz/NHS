<b>NodeMap</b> is a realtime web app based on Nodejs with Nowjs, Express, Ejs, Mongodb and Google Maps API v3.

<b>What the app does?</b><br/>
It drops realtime messages on the World Map in a very awesome way(at least I find it awesome). 

<b>How to use/test?</b><br/>
Simply submit a message from the form on the bottom left of the website. Either allow the webapp to use your location or provide latitude, longitude on your own.

Have fun with the app. Here is the app live in action : http://nodemap.no.de

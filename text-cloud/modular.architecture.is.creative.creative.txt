14:08 <mk30> i'm thinking early june
14:08 <mk30> cuz shani is going to be back in town for the big music festival she's working on: http://megapolisfestival.org/
14:08 <mk30> and she's down to do it while she's back in town
14:08 <jjjohnny_> oh sweet
14:09 <jjjohnny_> if that fest happens without my inclusion, it will be a sham
14:09 <mk30> haha, hustle yourself into it
14:09 <jjjohnny_> says too late for subs
14:09 <mk30> fuck it, play on the sidewalk
14:10 <mk30> like the cumbia guys.
14:10 <jjjohnny_> i played with the samba dudes at the lake merrit last weekend
14:10 <mk30> cool! i didn't even know there were samba dudes at lake merritt
14:10 <mk30> how did it go
14:10 <jjjohnny_> they want me to join the band
14:11 <mk30> awesome!
14:11 <mk30> you gonna do it?
14:11 <jjjohnny_> idk
14:11 <jjjohnny_> im gonna keep up playing at merrit tho
14:11 <jjjohnny_> with them, and with others
14:12 <mk30> nice
14:12 <jjjohnny_> and i will be convincing dancejs to move to omni
14:13 <jjjohnny_> i heard there were psych rock shows at omni, im getting left out
14:14 <mk30> whaaa
14:15 <mk30> guess you gotta be on that events list
14:15 <mk30> or the commons working group
14:15 <mk30> shani was wondering if dancejs would want to do a session at omni as part of hte festival
14:15 <mk30> cuz they have a few hackery workshops that are going to happen at sudo
14:16 <mk30> asking her if she still wants dancejs or something similar
14:16 <jjjohnny_> thx
14:17 <jjjohnny_> that would be a great mixin, if we did a show as part of the fest
14:19 <mk30> yea
14:19 <mk30> she said "not sure"
14:19 <mk30> and "gotta go"
14:19 <mk30> so i'll ask her again later
14:19 <jjjohnny_> thx
14:20 <jjjohnny_> also, cyberwiz
14:21 <jjjohnny_> i want to work on organizing that
14:22 <jjjohnny_> but like I think we should ocme to terms about a couple things
14:22 <jjjohnny_> 1.  making it ongoing, or longer and less bootcamp
14:22 <jjjohnny_> 2.  fundraising
14:23 <jjjohnny_> i know errbody wants to keep it free and open
14:23 <jjjohnny_> but i ain't got no money and every month I face a hustle for rent cash, that is currently fucking up my flow
14:24 <mk30> i understand

16:17 < kaotikus> fairly basic
16:31 < kaotikus> now checking out substack's json-scrape
16:32 < jerkey> kaotikus the dux miss you
17:20 < kaotikus> duckcam!
17:25 < jerkey> theres a cam on their feeder but they're only there at the top of the hour
17:26 < jerkey> i want to have more cameras that can be selected and aimed from remotely
17:26 < jerkey> but too many other things take priority
17:49 < substack> kaotikus: that tool is good for messy data but most json data is relatively clean

05:05 < substack> greweb: any html parser should be able to handle svg
05:05 < substack> you can use trumpet for example
05:05 < greweb> ok thanks :-) I was looking to xmldom right now

07:13 < jjjohnny_> but there is some game in helping more people to it
07:13 < jjjohnny_> that is what these ocnferences are about

07:15 < freeall> I sometimes wonder if conferences really changes opinions or if it's more for the people who already agree
                 with you
07:19 < jjjohnny_> freeall: both probably, but those are sets of people we care least about if our goal is to reach out
07:20 < substack> freeall: even among the faithful, reinforcing themes is important for community cohesion
07:20 < substack> and there are always new ideas coming down the pipe
07:21 < substack> I learned about a few new things just tonight from different folks, both online and in person
07:22 < substack> I think what draws people toward modularity is bad experiences with monoliths
07:22 < jjjohnny_> for every one person today in software dev, there will be at least two new ones this time next year
07:23 < jjjohnny_> or what it is, 18 months?
07:23 < freeall> I have started a job where I do more frontend. It really hurts to see how it's just not modular at all
07:23 < freeall> We use angular, and then all the "modules" are angular modules. It's painul.
07:24 < freeall> *painful
07:24 < jjjohnny_> Angular:  It's Worse than You Thought.  It's Panal
07:25 < jjjohnny_> most devs are building the row houses of software.
07:25 < jjjohnny_> we build works of functional art
07:26 < jjjohnny_> that you can live in
07:26 < freeall> I quite liked when React came out. It may not be entirely perfect, but it was refreshing to see that it's not
                 as all in as other frontend frameworks

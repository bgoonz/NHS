              think it's a similar line of thought to why slur wouldn't work
19:16 < woah> with a reputation system you have something that works better
              for someone selling lots of data of the same kind
19:16 < woah> sort of blackmail the entire population at once
19:16 < woah> scary
19:17 < woah> gonna happen, then we'll learn to encrypt
19:17 < nathan7> woah: SR seller accounts cost money
19:17 < woah> oh i didn't know that
19:17 < domanic> hmm
19:17 < nathan7> They're fairly expensive.
19:18 < woah> but well worth it! :P
19:18 < nathan7> It's simply not profitable to rip off a few people and get
                 banned.
19:18 < domanic> so that the owner of a secret can pay to suppress it is
                 probably dubious
19:18 < nathan7> Their supply is also limited.
19:18 < nathan7> domanic: information is not movable, it is copyable
19:18 < nathan7> to put it in Rust terms
19:19 < domanic> exactly
19:19 < woah> so, you think people would just give up hope of suppresing it?
19:19 < domanic> so like once you make an add for a zero day exploit
19:20 < domanic> either the ad is completely vague
19:20 < domanic> or it gives enough clues for other people to find it
19:21 < domanic> maybe this could work if you changed some things about it -
                 like made it more like a prediction market (still have
                 difficult problems in arbitration)
19:21 < nathan7> selling ownership of information is silly
19:22 < nathan7> that only *kind of* works when enforced with courts and a
              lack of clientside encryption
18:27 < nathan7> hm
18:27 < woah> highly publisized leaks of social media and messaging databases
              would be harmful in the short term, but beneficial in the long
              term
18:27 < woah> whereas if it never happens, the government can go on being
              omicient as long as they are not too blatant
18:27  * nathan7 will read this stuff when they're feeling better
18:28 < nathan7> rn my stomach hates me and my brain is jelly
18:47 < woah> oh man
18:47 < woah> i'm sorry to hear that nathan7
18:47 < woah> get well soon
18:56 < domanic> haha interesting
18:56 < domanic> I doubt that this slur thing will work though
18:57 < nathan7> I doubt it. I hope it doesn't.
18:57 < domanic> selling secrets on a open market place doesn't even make sense
18:57 < domanic> it much more valuable to sell secrets secretly - if that is
                 your thing
18:58 < domanic> otherwise one morning nathan7 wakes up and sees someone
                 selling "all nathan7's passwords"
18:58 < domanic> but instead of just buying your own secrets back, you just
                 change all your passwords
18:58 < domanic> etc etc
18:59 < domanic> Also I bet the arbitration system would be vulunerable to
                 attack
19:01 < nathan7> yeah, very much so
19:01 < nathan7> domanic: also, I'd just sell fake sets of my passwords
19:01 < nathan7> domanic: that would, in fact, be a sensible thing to do
19:02 < nathan7> domanic: it would ruin the credibility of anyone else
                 purporting to sell my passwords
19:02 < nathan7> domanic: and at worst, I get paid for misinformation
19:02 < domanic> nathan7, yeah just spam it with everything
19:02 < nathan7> domanic: it's even usable as plausible deniability system
19:02 < nathan7> domanic: "no, that password was stolen and sold!"
19:02 < domanic> that is when the arbitration comes into play I guess
19:02 < nathan7> domanic: "here, check these archive.org pages, that stuff was
                 for sale!"
19:03 < nathan7> domanic: "I can't possibly be held culpable for this, it
                 could've been anyone!"
19:03 < domanic> then they are gonna be like "hey these weren't really
                 nathan7's passwords!"
19:03 < domanic> and the seller is like "they where when I sold them"
19:04 < domanic> and they refund the sale I guess
19:04 < domanic> but then you get all this nonsense sales
19:04 < domanic> and so you have to add a collatoral
19:04 < nathan7> like, everyone gets fucked with
19:04 < domanic> sellers have to backup their sale with a security deposit
19:04 < woah>  is there data that is indepnedently verifiable, and can't be
              changed like passwords?
19:04 < nathan7> nobody gains anything
19:04 < domanic> and then you just attack that via the arbitration system
19:05 < domanic> woah, I guess there sometimes is
19:05 < domanic> but it would depend on pervasive digital signatures
19:06 < domanic> like, suppose someone is planning a bank robbery - and you
                 sell the powerpoint presentation they used to show the plan
                 to rest of the gang
19:06 < domanic> maybe you could sell this to the bank?
19:07 < woah> might be safer to do that than actually rob the plac
19:07 < domanic> haha yeah
19:07 < domanic> so everyone starts doing that
19:08 < domanic> and bank robbery plans become like nigerian spam
19:08 < domanic> what about selling hacked nude selfies?
19:09 < domanic> also, easily photoshoppable
19:09 < domanic> even if you used a body double to create an original material
                 that then then put celebrities faces on to
19:10 < woah> mm
19:10 < woah> what about selling text messages
19:10 < domanic> woah, like email dumps?
19:11 < woah> for 10 btc you can get bob's texts from the last year
19:11 < woah> maybe they're offering the texts of 1000's of people
19:12 < woah> would be prohibitively difficult to fake that
19:12 < domanic> right - this goes back to what nathan7 suggested
19:12 < woah> drug markets don't work in theory either
19:12 < domanic> okay so what makes those work is a reputation system
19:12 < woah> can be easily verified by seeing if it includes a text that you
              had sent bob
19:12 < woah> then you post a review or whatever
19:14 < domanic> woah, what is the theory underwhich silkroad etc do not work?
19:14 < woah> idunno, that's kind of a generalization, but i can see people
              sitting around talking about how sellers would just rip people
              off cause its anonymous
19:15 < woah> now that they exist it's taken for granted that they work, but i
              think it's a similar line of thought to why slur wouldn't work
19:16 < woah> with a reputation system you have something that works better
              for someone selling lots of data of the same kind
19:16 < woah> sort of blackmail the entire population at once
19:16 < woah> scary

19:22 < nathan7> that only *kind of* works when enforced with courts and a
                 monopoly of violence
19:22 < domanic> yeah you can only own something if you can withhold it
19:22 < nathan7> yeah
19:22 < nathan7> suppressing information requires violence
19:22 < domanic> but you could incentivise say, the solution to a problem
19:23 < nathan7> sure
19:23 < domanic> which could be finding a zero day in given piece of software
19:23 < nathan7> but then you have an underground crowdfunding system
19:23 < nathan7> and you can have consensus about whether that software is
                 sufficiently pwnt that they should receive the bounty
19:23 < domanic> which could be verified, and fixed, and then the finder paid
                 out to incentivise more security research
19:24 < domanic> this would be more of a wanted-ad than a auction
19:24 < domanic> it's just crowd funded bug bounties
19:25 < domanic> but the big question mark here is the verification system
19:26 < domanic> to verify that it really was a zero day

20:41 < jjjohnny_> domanic: that's cuz you haven't made your own comb yet

21:52 < substack> what we really need is a compact, well-specified binary
                  format for spatial indexes
21:52 < substack> and tools that can traverse them on disk or over bittorrent,
                  etc
21:53 < substack> spatial indexes are the same category of problem as
                  multidimensional database range queries
21:53 < substack> select * from employees where age > 30 and salary < 3000
21:54 < substack> or with even more dimensions
21:55 < domanic> substack, but we have a way to index it into one dimention
                 though, right?
21:55 < substack> yes
21:55  * jjjohnny_ fractals
21:55 < substack> 1 dimension is just binary search
21:55 < substack> and you can use B trees for it
21:56 < domanic> if age and salary where correlated then you could use a
                 spatial index thing too
21:56 < substack> they can be independent
21:57 < substack> with a kdb or bkd tree you end up with implied clustering
                  and O(lg n) reads
21:57 < substack> with bkd trees you even get amortized O(lg n) inserts
21:57 < domanic> right so we can think of them as a 2d space
21:57 < domanic> like a map
21:57 < substack> but bkd trees are very tricky, currently still trying to
                  make an implementation
21:58 < substack> r-trees can only get O(n) inserts, but they are easier to
                  implement and much more popular

Day changed to 26 Dec 2014
01:13 < substack> domanic: does ssb handle the problem of not knowing which
                  key to encrypt with?
01:13 < substack> if each of your devices has a separate key
01:13 < substack> and somebody wants to send you a message
01:13 < substack> how do they know which key they should encrypt with?
01:14 < substack> perhaps a passphrase can be generated and encrypted with
                  each key one by one and then the rest of the message is
                  encrypted with a symmetric cipher
01:20 < domanic> substack, we havn't solved that problem yet
01:20 < domanic> we don't have any end to end encryption yet
01:21 < substack> this is similar to
                  https://www.npmjs.com/package/hybrid-rsa-stream
01:21 < substack> except that there could be N asymmetric ciphertext blocks
01:21 < domanic> yes, correct
01:22 < domanic> we have talked about a way to say "X is also my device"
01:22 < domanic> and when you follow Y you also follow X
01:24 < domanic> by the way, you clone
                 https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebot and checkout the
                 gossip branch you can follow the instructions in the readme
                 to make my server follow you
04:23 < domanic> wow just watched movie about this:
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce
04:23 < domanic> very interesting from game theory perspective
04:24 < domanic> it's very interesting that cooperation spontaniously arose
                 BETWEEN warring sides
04:25 < domanic> but also, there is a second game going on for the soldiers of
                 each side
04:25 < domanic> basically, they are trapped in a loosing coordination game.
                 war is over if you want it.
04:25 < domanic> but if one person defects they get the firing squad
04:26 < domanic> if all the soliders refused to fight, then there couldn't be
                 a war, or even an army
04:27 < domanic> but there is some game here - which as far as I know has not
                 been defined - that explains building a coearsive heirachical
                 structure such as an army
04:43 < domanic> hmm... to coordinate the truce, all the soliders need to
                 disobey orders at the same time
04:44 < domanic> but someone needs to suggest this or there needs to be some
                 call
04:45 < domanic> so the authority just punishes the first to speak up (the
                 trouble maker)... as a consequence everyone is to scared to
                 do anything but follow orders
04:45 < domanic> so the question: how do we model this?
04:46 < domanic> modeling the truce forming thing is probably not the right
                 starting point
04:46 < domanic> but how does the first army form?

                  format for spatial indexes
21:52 < substack> and tools that can traverse them on disk or over bittorrent,
                  etc
21:53 < substack> spatial indexes are the same category of problem as
                  multidimensional database range queries
21:53 < substack> select * from employees where age > 30 and salary < 3000
21:54 < substack> or with even more dimensions
21:55 < domanic> substack, but we have a way to index it into one dimention
                 though, right?
21:55 < substack> yes
21:55  * jjjohnny_ fractals
21:55 < substack> 1 dimension is just binary search
21:55 < substack> and you can use B trees for it
21:56 < domanic> if age and salary where correlated then you could use a
                 spatial index thing too
21:56 < substack> they can be independent
21:57 < substack> with a kdb or bkd tree you end up with implied clustering
                  and O(lg n) reads
21:57 < substack> with bkd trees you even get amortized O(lg n) inserts
21:57 < domanic> right so we can think of them as a 2d space
21:57 < domanic> like a map
21:57 < substack> but bkd trees are very tricky, currently still trying to
                  make an implementation
21:58 < substack> r-trees can only get O(n) inserts, but they are easier to
                  implement and much more popular

22:35 < jjjohnny_> what if the tree is the index
22:37 < jjjohnny_> and you nosql that shit
22:38 < jjjohnny_> and every insert is a content addressable beotch
22:38 < jjjohnny_> with n dimensional comments trees
22:40 < jjjohnny_> then we can all talk about it
22:41 < jjjohnny_> and this implentation of this index is itself one these
                   indexes
22:42 < jjjohnny_> you know where comments go

01:13 < substack> domanic: does ssb handle the problem of not knowing which
                  key to encrypt with?
01:13 < substack> if each of your devices has a separate key
01:13 < substack> and somebody wants to send you a message
01:13 < substack> how do they know which key they should encrypt with?
01:14 < substack> perhaps a passphrase can be generated and encrypted with
                  each key one by one and then the rest of the message is
                  encrypted with a symmetric cipher
01:20 < domanic> substack, we havn't solved that problem yet
01:20 < domanic> we don't have any end to end encryption yet
01:21 < substack> this is similar to
                  https://www.npmjs.com/package/hybrid-rsa-stream
01:21 < substack> except that there could be N asymmetric ciphertext blocks
01:21 < domanic> yes, correct
01:22 < domanic> we have talked about a way to say "X is also my device"
01:22 < domanic> and when you follow Y you also follow X
01:24 < domanic> by the way, you clone
                 https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebot and checkout the
                 gossip branch you can follow the instructions in the readme
                 to make my server follow you
04:23 < domanic> wow just watched movie about this:
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce
04:23 < domanic> very interesting from game theory perspective
04:24 < domanic> it's very interesting that cooperation spontaniously arose
                 BETWEEN warring sides
04:25 < domanic> but also, there is a second game going on for the soldiers of
                 each side
04:25 < domanic> basically, they are trapped in a loosing coordination game.
                 war is over if you want it.
04:25 < domanic> but if one person defects they get the firing squad
04:26 < domanic> if all the soliders refused to fight, then there couldn't be
                 a war, or even an army
04:27 < domanic> but there is some game here - which as far as I know has not
                 been defined - that explains building a coearsive heirachical
                 structure such as an army
04:43 < domanic> hmm... to coordinate the truce, all the soliders need to
                 disobey orders at the same time
04:44 < domanic> but someone needs to suggest this or there needs to be some
                 call
04:45 < domanic> so the authority just punishes the first to speak up (the
                 trouble maker)... as a consequence everyone is to scared to
                 do anything but follow orders
04:45 < domanic> so the question: how do we model this?
04:46 < domanic> modeling the truce forming thing is probably not the right
                 starting point
04:46 < domanic> but how does the first army form?

05:48 < yuvadm> similar to how forming a workers union goes
05:48 < yuvadm> i'd model this as a cumulative probability function
05:48 < yuvadm> 100% of soldiers/workers uniting is 100% success
05:49 < yuvadm> but perhaps only N/10 actors is good enough to get 50% success?
05:50 < yuvadm> or, say, in north korea even N/2 actors is still 2% success

                     before the dinosaurs :)
13:13 < ednapiranha> it's easier to criticize based on previous flaws vs
                     trying it out and contributing to making it better no?
13:13 < jjjohnny_> nah i test my warez
13:13 < ednapiranha> i smell troll
13:13 < jjjohnny_> i wanted to to use asm, to get better js perf
13:13 < jjjohnny_> but its not for js
13:13 < ednapiranha> talk to me when your troll hat is off :)
13:14 < jjjohnny_> ok you try writing asm code
13:14 < ednapiranha> no i have better things to do

15:44 < domanic> jjjohnny_, not sure what you mean
15:50 < jjjohnny_> domanic: the wild is a paranoid state
15:50 < jjjohnny_> pure paranoia
15:51 < jjjohnny_> animals live in am almost purely trustless env
15:51 < domanic> jjjohnny_, they can play tit-4-tat
15:52 < jjjohnny_> and w/o collateral, you can't force trustworthiness on a
                   potential ally
15:52 < domanic> correct
15:52 < jjjohnny_> tit 4 tat reduces badly
15:52 < domanic> what do you mean?
15:52 < jjjohnny_> but that was deconstructionista
15:52 < jjjohnny_> i was about to tweet you the creator gods voice
15:53 < domanic> tit4tat works fairly well actually, well it works to a degree
15:53 < domanic> it is enough to get cooperation, even in an enviroment where
                 you cannot communicate
15:53 < domanic> though, it's much easier in a two player game
15:54 < domanic> in an N player game you have a big coordination problem
15:54 < jjjohnny_> a fight or mating match
15:54 < jjjohnny_> is tit for tat
15:55 < jjjohnny_> but that is probably about as far as you can go without
                   more abstract concepts
15:55 < domanic> I mean t4t in the context of Iterated Prisoners Delimma
15:56 < domanic> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated
_prisoners.27_dilemma
15:56 < jjjohnny_> hasn't PD been proved to have non combative resolutions tho
15:57 < domanic> jjjohnny_, yes - t4t. if you start out cooperating, and then
                 punish them if they defect
15:57 < domanic> that makes a highly robust strategy, in many cases
15:58 < jjjohnny_> this shit incenses me rly
15:58 < jjjohnny_> players will defect in the last, given completely paraniod
                   schizo premices!
15:59 < domanic> not if they don't know when the last round will be
15:59 < jjjohnny_> i see, but i dont like the entire premice of the PD
15:59 < domanic> if you have a known N turns, then dominant strategy is
                 defect, but if you don't know N then it's not.
15:59 < jjjohnny_> premise jjjohnny_
16:00 < domanic> jjjohnny_, how so?
16:01 < jjjohnny_> because the premise is you are a prisoner and your actions
                   are to act solo
16:01 < jjjohnny_> you can betray, or not betray
16:02 < jjjohnny_> we are humans, with advanced culture, and ways of
                   mitigating that premise altogether
16:04 < jjjohnny_> i mean, we can start from a different premise.  but if we
                   build a culture on top of those premises, which macro econ
                   systems have found profitable, then we get stupid people
                   who don't know how to play this game with positive
                   consequences, or people who don't care cuz if other people
                   play positively, they know they can gain by cleverly
                   betraying the rest
16:05 < jjjohnny_> paranoid schizo decodes modern economic systems.  modern
                   economic systems is like, sweet, thanks, here's a prize.
16:05 < jjjohnny_> im wrong here probably
16:06 < jjjohnny_> especially since it seems like we have to use the same game
                   for DEXes
16:06 < jjjohnny_> DEX = decentralized exchange
16:06 < jjjohnny_> i think it covers all decentralized systems
16:07 < domanic> jjjohnny_, yes absolutely
16:07 < domanic> humans are playing a different game or something
16:07 < domanic> that classic game theory doesn't quite capture
16:08 < jjjohnny_> yeah but we seem to be several layers built on top of it
16:08 < jjjohnny_> our modern economic and political systems
16:09 < domanic> yeah, I'm looking for the research that models that
16:09 < jjjohnny_> better jus call me a jerkface and get it over with
16:09 < domanic> what?
16:09 < jjjohnny_> i dont have the research to back up muh claims
16:10 < jjjohnny_> when you said "im looking for the research" i interpretted
                   that as, where is the research johnny? and then I mixed
                   that with what you said about jerkfaces
16:10 < domanic> I'm not even sure if that research exists yet
16:11 < domanic> oh no, I think you are right
16:11 < domanic> there has been stuff about how most people don't actually
                 play PD "optimally"
16:12 < domanic> the traditional answer is "they are stupid" but it's not
                 really a solved thing
16:12 < domanic> "stupid" isn't a scientific theory
16:12 < domanic> we are past the bounds of the wikipedia article now, into
                 real science
16:12 < jjjohnny_> what is the game where you switch the premise?
16:13 < jjjohnny_> !PD
16:13 < domanic> I don't know that game
16:13 < jjjohnny_> its all one, proceed
16:13 < jjjohnny_> it is possible the corporations are kind of the oppossite
16:14 < jjjohnny_> they employee loads of dumb people, and let them
                   haldassedly proceed at doing things that generally work in
                   the groups favor
16:14 < jjjohnny_> falfassedly
16:14 < domanic> yeah
16:14 < jjjohnny_> halfassedly
16:15 < domanic> although, they don't really get a fair share
16:15 < domanic> of the booty
16:15 < domanic> instead the corp takes most of the profit, and puts it into
                 growth
16:15 < jjjohnny_> yeah it lacks democracy
16:16 < domanic> my new idea: orgs like that, armies etc, are carefully
                 constructed coordination problems
16:16 < domanic> it *would* be in the interest of the workers to demand better
                 terms
16:16 < domanic> but it's hard for them to rally for that
16:17 < domanic> because the authorities just punish the first trouble maker
                 that sticks their head up
16:18 < domanic> and the trouble makers leave, and eventually end up hanging
                 out on IRC
16:18 < domanic> with the other trouble makers
16:18 < jjjohnny_> an army of troublemakers forms
16:19 < domanic> jjjohnny_, here is a great description of coordination
                 problems:
                 http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html#coordination_problems
16:20 < domanic> question is: could we solve this with a cryptosystem?

16:28 < jjjohnny_> given a group, it is possible to start at a fully
                   cooperative premise
16:28 < jjjohnny_> but not if power if unequally distributed amongst the vote
16:28 < jjjohnny_> is
16:29 < jjjohnny_> then, cooperative groups use their increased power to
                   oppress negative non-cooperators, or pay tribute to
                   positive non-cooperators
16:31 < jjjohnny_> eventually cooperation replaces competition as the dominant
                   culture, everybody relaxes, and the tyrants return

16:37 < domanic> jjjohnny_, in some cases maybe
16:38 < domanic> probably you don't want the boss to know you are coordinating

16:38 < domanic> (in some cases, "the boss" is nature)
16:38 < domanic> like climate change
16:39 < jjjohnny_> that redefined boss as an absolute and indsicriinate power
16:39 < domanic> in other cases, people construct these coordination problems
                 - and you'd need to by anonymous to them
16:40 < domanic> only for the purposes of a simplified model

16:41 < domanic> haha, lets not go there
16:41 < jjjohnny_> of course not
16:41 < domanic> there are many things closer to home though
16:42 < jjjohnny_> for me, I do not see the need to solve this without a cause
16:42 < jjjohnny_> and we have many causes
16:43 < domanic> yes, but it's a general problem, that can be described
                 abstractly
16:43 < domanic> it's just a problem that language speaking creatures have
16:44 < jjjohnny_> i guess it would be something to solve it at a sort of
                   axiomatic level
16:44 < domanic> if they are able to perform actions that have positive or
                 negative effects on other language creatures
16:44 < jjjohnny_> i just don't know if we are smart enough to do it with user
                   interfaces
16:44 < jjjohnny_> without
16:45 < domanic> that is another couple of layers on top
16:45 < jjjohnny_> or instruments for to gather evidence
16:46 < jjjohnny_> incentive is abstract
16:47 < jjjohnny_> if PD takes the premice of the humans being isolated
16:47 < jjjohnny_> then !PD must take the premise that the members form a group
16:47 < jjjohnny_> from now on pumice = premise
16:48 < jjjohnny_> c is an index finger what
16:48 < jjjohnny_> so there, you have to begin with the pumice that
                   coordination happens amongst a group
16:48 < jjjohnny_> and I am genius
16:51 < jjjohnny_> now, is the group finite, boundless, static or dyanmic
16:56 < jjjohnny_> !PD the action is not to betray or !betray

16:57 < jjjohnny_> should I continue with this, or write songs of protest?

17:24 < jjjohnny_> as in the feeling of
17:27 < domanic> my talk on these humans playing PD experiments is that it
                 disproves the model
17:28 < jjjohnny_> where?
17:28 < jjjohnny_> video?
17:28 < domanic> like the paper you linked
17:28 < domanic> bachi.pdf
17:29 < jjjohnny_> your talk?
17:30 < domanic> sorry
17:30 < domanic> typo
17:30 < domanic> I meant "take"
17:31 < domanic> that humans play PD "wrong" *could* be explained that "humans
                 are stupid"
17:31 < domanic> but that doesn't really tell us very much
17:32 < domanic> jjjohnny_, I think we would both agree that the real answer
                 might be that the model is wrong
17:32 < domanic> humans actually play a different game
17:33 < domanic> and like, people don't want to be a douchebag on a gameshow
                 because they are still humans and being on a gameshow is just
                 a small part of a larger game called being human
17:33 < jjjohnny_> the wikipedia page says that ration leads to cooperative
                   with only an agreed upon forecast by the players
17:33 < jjjohnny_> rationality*
17:34 < jjjohnny_> ergo like I said, a premise of cooperation amongst the group
17:35 < jjjohnny_> the paradox is, if you break with cooperation, you get set
                   free
17:35 < domanic> jjjohnny_, can you link me to that bit?

17:39 < jjjohnny_> domanic: i sense that modeling multiplayer as "two-players
                   with a positive / negative meter" will work for starters
17:39 < jjjohnny_> I wonder if my multiplayer game of life game would work for
                   this simulation
17:40 < jjjohnny_> cuz it only has two teams, but multi players
17:40 < jjjohnny_> pronably not, GOL is not a proper model
17:43 < domanic> bbiab breakfast
17:43 < jjjohnny_> hm, but a group could use its majority power to defect,
                   would that be defecting?
17:44 < jjjohnny_> cooperation must mean it should not be the detriment of any
                   members
17:44 < jjjohnny_> rather than
17:44 < jjjohnny_> the benefit of the group
17:45 < jjjohnny_> cuz a majority defection is basically a cartel
17:45 < jjjohnny_> so cartel busting is a crucial tactic
17:47 < jjjohnny_> i saw some research on cartel busting tactics, which was to
                   go at the middle men.  same shit i've been divining since I
                   was 14.
17:48 < jjjohnny_> but then i realized that middlemanning can be important and
                   good
17:48 < jjjohnny_> but it needs to be mitigated
17:48 < jjjohnny_> perhaps communication is itsef the middle man

17:57 < jjjohnny_> concensus plays a role or it doesn't
17:59 < jjjohnny_> i think concensus is the reactor to consequence
18:00 < jjjohnny_> consensus simply must imply absolute agreement
18:01 < jjjohnny_> and so can therefor apply to axioms, or modelsm or w.e
18:02 < jjjohnny_> there must be consequences, good, bad, null, and ugly
18:11 < jjjohnny_> anaonymously changing your "trust" of another member
18:11 < jjjohnny_> if u drop below a level...
18:12 < jjjohnny_> that way, if somebody comes to with a scam, you have

18:12 < jjjohnny_> you don't have to agree,disagree, out them or yourself

18:46 < domanic> good article:
                   good

17:57 < jjjohnny_> concensus plays a role or it doesn't
17:59 < jjjohnny_> i think concensus is the reactor to consequence
18:00 < jjjohnny_> consensus simply must imply absolute agreement
18:01 < jjjohnny_> and so can therefor apply to axioms, or modelsm or w.e
18:02 < jjjohnny_> there must be consequences, good, bad, null, and ugly
18:11 < jjjohnny_> anaonymously changing your "trust" of another member
18:11 < jjjohnny_> if u drop below a level...
18:12 < jjjohnny_> that way, if somebody comes to with a scam, you have
                   immediate recourse
18:12 < jjjohnny_> you don't have to agree,disagree, out them or yourself
18:13 < jjjohnny_> but if he tries to get a bunch of ppl in on the scam, and
                   they all as a result lower trust for him, poof
18:14 < jjjohnny_> he was essentially a middle man for a would be scam or
                   cartel or simply some nonsense that goes against the group
18:14 < jjjohnny_> we are gonna need hella empjis tho so we don't end up
                   missing the meaning of our social messages
18:16 < jjjohnny_> OTOH if u have enough trust, you can do things on behalf of
                   the group without first getting consensus
18:18 < jjjohnny_> well I accomplished something today
18:19 < domanic> jjjohnny_, what is empjis?
18:22 < jjjohnny_> emojis

18:26 < jjjohnny_> cuz ppl dont knew ppl silly and dont mean shit sometimes u
                   know what I mean that you don't know what I mean bruh?
18:26 < jjjohnny_> trust is a float value

                   good, fun multi player socket connected games full stack,

20:52 < domanic> what about a model of a community, where each agent gets to
                 "think" run the model forward (to some degree) and use this
                 to choose strategy?
20:54 < domanic> humans have language, so they can do things like suggest
                 strategies to others, and also declare their own strategies
                 (i.e. threaten each other - I will cast you out of paradise
                 if you eat the forbidden fruit)

22:35 < jjjohnny_> domanic: what is the game? deos the model need to be a game?
22:36 < domanic> jjjohnny_, in this context "game" is just a thing where
                 multiple parties make decisions and get a score

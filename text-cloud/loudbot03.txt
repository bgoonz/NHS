12:28 < defunctzombie> airportyh: I agree it is messed up

12:28 < defunctzombie> I think we should open links in an iframe on the right
12:28 < airportyh> no it's there, just way down in the page
12:29 < airportyh> it's getting a bad score because it doesn't have github url linked
12:29 < defunctzombie> airportyh: I think we should give higher prority to exact module name matches
12:29 < defunctzombie> ah
12:29 < defunctzombie> for example a search for "array"
12:29 < defunctzombie> returns eventemitter2 as the first result

12:31 < airportyh> I guess their readme just has lots of content about everything
12:31 < defunctzombie> heh
12:32 < airportyh> I guess a more sophisticated approach would be a page-rank like thing
12:32 < defunctzombie> we should weigh the keywords and module description higher than the readme
12:32 < airportyh> it already does that
12:32 < airportyh> by having those higher in the search body
12:32 < airportyh> but not enough
12:32 < defunctzombie> ah
12:33 < airportyh> the thing is some readmes talk endlessly about how good their tests are
12:33 < airportyh> and so end up getting ranked for test
12:33 < defunctzombie> rofl
12:33 < defunctzombie> maybe we should only grab the first N words of the readme
12:33 -!- kriskowal [~kriskowal@98.234.185.126] has joined #stackvm
12:34 < defunctzombie> good readmes generally have a description first
12:34 < defunctzombie> and a few other details
12:34 < defunctzombie> test stuff comes later
12:34 < airportyh> yeah we could try that
12:34 < dguttman> and then there was the rise of module SEO
12:34 < defunctzombie> :D
12:34 < airportyh> :) page rank could weed these out too
12:35 < airportyh> like if it's dependent on by other test related modules?
12:35 < defunctzombie> I have a friend who use to work for google
12:35 < defunctzombie> doing machine learning
12:35 < dguttman> Sample TODO mvc framework. Tests, browserify, level, tests, tape, dat, test
12:35 < defunctzombie> I might be able to convince him to take a look at some things
12:35 < airportyh> that would be great
12:36 < airportyh> I have the python "collective intelligence" book next to me
12:37 < airportyh> I am happy that superagent gets rank 2nd for ajax
12:38 < airportyh> but jquery is like 15th for dom
12:39 < defunctzombie> haha
12:39 < defunctzombie> airportyh: I think a heart is misleading for dependencies
12:39 < defunctzombie> makes me think likes
12:39 < defunctzombie> airportyh: maybe use a chain icon
12:39 < defunctzombie> airportyh: search for "link" on icomoon

16:40 < airportyh> defunctzombie: if we spawn browserify then we can timeout and kill it

                   https://github.com/substack/node-resolve/blob/master/lib/async.js#L65-L106
17:06 < airportyh> so github's "main" is set to "."

17:22 < defunctzombie> possible fix is for that module's main to be fixed

02:03 < substack> but iso8601 dates are sortable

02:05 < dominictarr> JSON.stringify(date) is sortable
02:05 < substack> yes it's iso8601 or thereabouts
02:06 < dominictarr> this all gets bytewise encoded so unix or iso are both
                     sortable
02:06 < substack> oh!
02:06 < substack> if it's encoded with bytewise then I would actually lean
                  toward integers
02:06 < substack> but I'm not sure why
02:07 < substack> that's just what my fast heuristic brain that can't explain
                  itself is telling me
02:07 < dominictarr> yeah - it's less bytes and that is better for indexes.
02:08 < dominictarr> since bytewise is not human readable anyway, then there is
                     no advantage to putting a human readable encoding inside
                     of it.
02:08 < dominictarr> okay cool.

                  is special
12:20 < thlorenz> juliangruber: remember from C that stdout stuff gets buffered
                  and flushed later, while fprintf(stderr) gets flushed right
                  away
12:20 < defunctzombie> iirc stdout is async but stderr is not.. but I could be
                       wrong
12:20 < thlorenz> defunctzombie: cuz it gets buffered and flushed later right?
12:20 < defunctzombie> yea

12:31 < defunctzombie> heh
12:32 < airportyh> I guess a more sophisticated approach would be a page-rank
                   like thing
12:32 < defunctzombie> we should weigh the keywords and module description
                       higher than the readme
12:32 < airportyh> it already does that
12:32 < airportyh> by having those higher in the search body
12:32 < airportyh> but not enough
12:32 < defunctzombie> ah
12:33 < airportyh> the thing is some readmes talk endlessly about how good
                   their tests are
12:33 < airportyh> and so end up getting ranked for test

12:34 < defunctzombie> test stuff comes later
12:34 < airportyh> yeah we could try that
12:34 < dguttman> and then there was the rise of module SEO
12:34 < defunctzombie> :D
12:34 < airportyh> :) page rank could weed these out too
12:35 < airportyh> like if it's dependent on by other test related modules?

16:39 < airportyh> defunctzombie: https://gist.github.com/airportyh/10930576

16:40 < defunctzombie> sounds like a browserify bug
16:40 < defunctzombie> probably something with streams
16:40 < defunctzombie> I blame all problems on streams
16:40 < airportyh> defunctzombie: if we spawn browserify then we can timeout

18:28 < thealphanerd> Raynos / substack / ogd : do you guys have a prefered folder structure / work flow for building reusable browserify
                      modules?
18:29 < ogd> thealphanerd: for me 'reusable' and 'browserify' are implied by 'module' :)
18:29 < thealphanerd> :P
18:29 < ogd> thealphanerd: and in terms of folder structure no, i just have some js files that relative require each other, sometimes i have
             a subfolder for css, js etc
18:30 < thealphanerd> Ill rephrase& Im trying to develop a workflow that can be reused by developers to create widgets over at famo.us

                      with a cannonical design pattern
18:31 < ogd> thealphanerd: for me its npm init, npm install --save <dependencies, npm install --save-dev <development dependencies>, make
             sure `npm test` runs the test suite, make sure `npm start` starts a local dev server (if applicable)
18:32 -!- ceejbot [~ceejbot@50-1-57-179.static.sonic.net] has joined #stackvm

18:37 < ogd> thealphanerd: do you mean node or browserify?
18:37 < thealphanerd> a doy
18:37 < thealphanerd> yeah
18:37 < ogd> well sort of, you can use the 'browser' field in package.json to override dependencies

21:39  * jjjohnny exits thru budoir door and returns with cloak, dagger

21:42 <jjjohnny> yeah looks it
21:42 <jjjohnny> have you been feeling well lately?
21:43 <mk30> no, yourself?
21:44 <jjjohnny> yes

21:46 <jjjohnny> yeah gaurav has been manic
21:46 <mk30> oh :\ is he bipolar?
21:46 <jjjohnny> and i have been his steward and willing foil
21:46 <jjjohnny> i guess
21:47 <mk30> you sure he's manic and not just...up?
21:47 <jjjohnny> its hard for me to say, cuz i generally disagree with modern psychology
21:47 <mk30> sure
21:47 <mk30> i disagree with psychology too, but the pills are for real :P
21:47 <jjjohnny> but he seems to have a medicated history
21:47 <mk30> that's a tricky one to navigate for me personally
21:47 <mk30> i see
21:48 <jjjohnny> and i think he is off them
21:48 <jjjohnny> but like, if u asked me, i would not suggest otherwise
21:48  * jjjohnny dangerous
21:48 <mk30> you wouldn't suggest he get on them?
21:48 <jjjohnny> no
21:49 <jjjohnny> its just me, i cant
21:49 <jjjohnny> to anyone
21:49 <mk30> you wouldn't suggest to anyone that they get on meds? (just making sure i understand what you're saying)
21:49 <jjjohnny> that is correct
21:50 <jjjohnny> i mean pharmaceudicals
21:50 <mk30> understood
21:50 <jjjohnny> but i have a way of my own
21:50 <jjjohnny> its called
21:50 <jjjohnny> the way of the god monkey's hand
21:50 <mk30> what does that mean
21:51 <jjjohnny> it is the name, and u know what shakespeare said about those
21:51 <mk30> rose, etc
21:51 <mk30> ?
21:51 <jjjohnny> yep
21:52 <jjjohnny> the way of the god monkey's hand is not without significance within a contexts
21:52 <mk30> what does it involve
21:52 <jjjohnny> without / within
21:53 <jjjohnny> mental & martial arts
21:53 <jjjohnny> where like the mental is for the martial and martial is for the mental
21:53 <jjjohnny> i could easily become a yoga charlatan
21:54 <jjjohnny> but i keeps it real and jus me
21:56 <jjjohnny> im only getting back into the way of the god monkey's hand

13:23 < mikolalysenko> it seems like a lot of the next generation package managers are going for github/url based packages
13:23 < mikolalysenko> not sure how I feel about this without some kind of signing mechanism
13:31 < guybrush> you can sign your commits witgh gpg, or do you mean something else?
13:32 -!- yoshuawuyts [~yoshuawuy@37.74.139.238] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
13:32 < guybrush> i like it somehow, but semver is a problem with git
13:33 < guybrush> i think a good solution would be to put version-informations into something besides the actual git-urls
13:34 < guybrush> like a npm which _only_ manages versions for git-urls
13:34 < guybrush> and nothing but versions
13:35 < guybrush> so you can add your git-url in this gitversions-registry and create versions which point to sha1
13:36 < mikolalysenko> I was thinking of something like namecoin
13:37 < guybrush> ooh i think i saw you writing about this in here
13:37 < guybrush> like a dht for versions
13:37 < mikolalysenko> I want some way to verify that if I install version x.y.z of module foo, it really is foo x.y.z and not the NSA's foo
                       x.y.z + secret backdoor
13:38 < mikolalysenko> or even less maliciously, if the author decides to retcon a version then I won't screwed by their (possibly well
                       intenioned) revisions
13:38 < guybrush> right thats one of the cool features of git :D
13:38 < mikolalysenko> basically github/urls don't enforce the immutability of published modules
13:38 < guybrush> since you can sign your commits with gpg
13:38 < mikolalysenko> hmm
13:39 < mikolalysenko> but if I just specify a url in my package.json, how would I verify that?
13:39 < guybrush> so when you know the sha1 you can be pretty damn sure its the source you want

13:39 < mikolalysenko> I would need to include the pgp key in the package.json for that version too I think
13:39 < guybrush> well the commit-message is used to create the sha1
13:40 < mikolalysenko> yeah, I agree there are ways this could be implemented
13:40 < mikolalysenko> but the problem is that without some central registry of package names/hashes it doesn't do you any good
13:40 < guybrush> yes
13:40 < mikolalysenko> or else you would have to specify the hash code in your package.json
13:41 < guybrush> semver in general is just not a feature of git :D
13:41 < mikolalysenko> well, you could just add a file to git like package.json and use that to track versions
13:41 < guybrush> since there is nothing but the sha1 which is permanent and solid
13:41 < mikolalysenko> yeah, but even that has problems
13:41 < guybrush> right! i thought about that too
13:42 < guybrush> yes i think its complicated since you just can change the file anyway
13:42 < mikolalysenko> since if I identify a module by a url, there is nothing stopping that remote server from arbitrarily changing the
                       contents of the gitrepo/whatever
13:42 < guybrush> its like using the tag-names or branch-names
13:42 < guybrush> sure
13:42 -!- phated [~phated@72.44.240.228] has joined #stackvm
13:42 < mikolalysenko> or even of having that server go down/move to a new location
13:42 < guybrush> but i use git to download
13:42 < guybrush> not the url
13:42 -!- kessler [~kessler@ODAP-199-203-61-108.bb.netvision.net.il] has joined #stackvm
13:43 < mikolalysenko> the real issue is that urls are not suitable for naming packages/modules
13:43 < mikolalysenko> a central authority (like npm) is a valid solution, but it is not distributed
13:43 < mikolalysenko> systems like namecoin seem better, but no one is doing this today
13:45 < guybrush> i guess you could just put all the npm packages into torrents and track them
13:45 < mikolalysenko> yeah or however else you want to do it
13:45 < mikolalysenko> distribution is really a separate problem from signing/naming
13:45 < guybrush> right i see
13:46 < guybrush> not sure about this namecoin
13:46 < mikolalysenko> it seems like a reasonable platform, and I think it would work
13:46 < mikolalysenko> unlink btc it also ensures the uniqueness of names
13:47 < guybrush> so
13:47 < guybrush> it would basically just be names->hashsums?
13:48 < guybrush> then i load the package from anywhere and use namecoin to verify
13:48 < mikolalysenko> yep
13:48 < guybrush> it sounds really nice
13:48 < mikolalysenko> namecoin securely does the first part
13:48 < mikolalysenko> and the rest is whatever you want (ipfs maybe? :) )
13:49 < mikolalysenko> it could be just some big dht really
13:50 < guybrush> well you can just put it into torrents AND on github AND on npm and and and
13:50 -!- warbrett [~warbrett@72.44.240.228] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
13:50 < guybrush> as long as there is some unique registry where you can find the hashsums+urls
13:51 < mikolalysenko> yeah, or really package name + hashsum
13:51 < mikolalysenko> doesn't need to be a url
13:51 < guybrush> but then how do you know where to download?
13:51 < mikolalysenko> you could have different registries and mechanisms
13:51 < guybrush> oh i see its really not so important
13:51 < mikolalysenko> for example a big dht of all the modules ever published, where you give it the hashsum and it pulls it down for you
13:52 < mikolalysenko> and then you verify that with the key in the registry
13:52 < guybrush> so the name has to include versions too
13:52 < mikolalysenko> yes
13:52 < mikolalysenko> the package name would be:  packagename@major.minor.patch
13:52 < guybrush> yes you convinced me it would be really cool thing :D
13:53 < mikolalysenko> it is obviously how it should work. but no one is doing it yet
13:53 < mikolalysenko> though npm is a valid solution too
13:53 -!- warbrett [~warbrett@72.44.240.228] has joined #stackvm
13:53 < guybrush> right
13:53 < mikolalysenko> I think a central authority is a fine solution in the short term, just like dns/ca systems are fine solutions too
13:54 < mikolalysenko> but the real issue is that the fake "distributed" url system that package managers like go get or component use is
                       problematic
13:54 < mikolalysenko> because they get the worst of all worlds
13:54 < guybrush> hm yes
13:55 < mikolalysenko> if you want to create a distributed package manager, which is a noble goal I think, then you need to address the
                       naming and immutability problem somehow
13:55 < mikolalysenko> the consequence of failing to do this is your code can suddenly fail due to the failure of a remote server
13:56 < mikolalysenko> whereas if you have a naming system, then the module can survive even if its original host machine dies
13:57 < mikolalysenko> basically package managers like go get or bower really amount to a glorified wget/curl implementation
13:58 < mikolalysenko> cargo and component are one step above this, in that they use the npm trick of copying modules, but are not secure
13:58 < mikolalysenko> npm is secure, but not distributed
13:58 < mikolalysenko> afaik, nothing out there is doing distributed secure modules

14:27 < domanic> mikolalysenko, all the central registry really needs to do is assign module names to public keys
14:28 < domanic> I'd request a name from the registry, it would respond with a certificate that says by public key is now responsible for
                 the name X
14:28 < domanic> then, I can publish blobs (id'ed by hash(content))
14:29 < domanic> and sign (my_key, name@version->hash(content))
14:29 < domanic> then distribute that along with the cert from the registry that says I own that name.

14:33 -!- captainplanet [~thealphan@pdpc/supporter/student/thealphanerd] has joined #stackvm
14:33 < domanic> use http and urls to retrive it if you want, but the url has to contain the hash
14:33 < domanic> then any one can mirror a subset (if they want) no problems
14:33 < domanic> you could even have namespaces - the main registry would sign a cert that says I own a name space
14:33 < domanic> I could even create my own registry to give out names under that name space
14:33 < domanic> of course - you could use a namecoin or a proof of stake thing (stake == module publishing?) but that is complex unless
                 there is a good implementation available
14:33 -!- captainplanet is now known as thealphanerd
14:34 < domanic> also, once you own a name - you can sign updates to it without consulting the registry, this would be cool because you
                 could publish offline
14:35 < substack> or publish to a mirror
14:35 < domanic> publish anywhere ... you'd just announce the cert + tarball hash
14:36 < domanic> you could also treat the hash(user_pubkey) as a name space
14:36 -!- jxson [jxson@nat/google/x-dbuoxglmlzxhrrfc] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
14:36 < domanic> so you could always install hash(substack_key)/browserify
14:37 < domanic> I guess the only thing is sometimes your system would have to search through a few databases to find a given hash
14:40 -!- contrahax is now known as _contrahax
14:45 < domanic> in this model - the registry is just a key that assigns namespace certs to other keys
14:45 < domanic> and the other keys, do the same, but to their own namespace
14:51 < domanic> so, a namespace is just an append-only list of signed name-> hash tuples
14:52 < mikolalysenko> domanic: yeah, though again you could build this on top of namecoin
14:53 < domanic> and if the hash is of a public key, (maybe include a type field) it would become the key that makes signatures under that
                 name.
14:53 < domanic> mikolalysenko, sure - that is kinda expensive though, what with proof of work, etc
14:53 < mikolalysenko> I think it would be fine actually
14:54 < mikolalysenko> you don't really need realtime publishing for modules, it should be ok to wait a few minutes before it goes live
14:54 < mikolalysenko> and downloading / verifying from namecoin would be very fast
14:54 < domanic> ... as long as there is a way to install it into another module immediately
14:55 < mikolalysenko> well, you could always have local offline mechanisms for rapid debugging and so on, like npm link  etc.
14:55 < mikolalysenko> the namecoin system would just be for the final publishing step when you are ready to ship something
14:56 < mikolalysenko> one downside though is you would have to buy namecoins to publish modules
14:56 < mikolalysenko> which is more expensive than npm
14:56 < domanic> buying a namecoin == mining a namecoin?
14:56 < mikolalysenko> either way
14:56 < mikolalysenko> someone has to mine it
14:56 < mikolalysenko> and then they can sell it later on a market
14:56 < mikolalysenko> but you need to spend namecoins to register names
14:57 < mikolalysenko> and the miners will collect those coins as transaction fees
14:57 -!- gozala [uid5923@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-wvxjuyprbbyxcqjm] has joined #stackvm
14:57 < mikolalysenko> in exchange for doing the work of securing the network
14:57 < domanic> I don't know if paying for module names is really an improvement over npm, decentralized or not
14:58 < mikolalysenko> that is true
14:58 < mikolalysenko> I am also not sure that the central authority model npm uses is really that terrible
14:58 < mikolalysenko> at least as long as npm continues to act in good faith, it is a fine solution
14:59 < domanic> well, as long as it's not a monolopy
14:59 < mikolalysenko> though for other languages out there like rust, go, etc. that want to green field their own package management
                       systems I don't understand why they wouldn't want to try for this type of approach
15:00 < mikolalysenko> I believe that npm's approach is technically defensible and rational, but systems like go get seem like a step
                       backward
15:00 < domanic> ... it's still a bit madscience though...
15:00 < mikolalysenko> oh yeah
15:00 < domanic> unless stackvm builds the package manager!
15:01 < domanic> mikolalysenko, non of the other languages can have a pm as nice as npm unless they also support version conflicts, i.e.
                 something equiv to node_modules pattern
15:01 < mikolalysenko> cargo does this actually
15:01 < mikolalysenko> which is the rust package manager
15:02 < mikolalysenko> but it also uses the same system as component for naming modules
15:02 < mikolalysenko> so the individual packages themself are identified by urls
15:02 < domanic> oh really? can one application use 2 versions of module X?
15:02 < mikolalysenko> yes
15:02 < mikolalysenko> it uses semver
15:02 < mikolalysenko> go does not, but their system is kind of lame
15:02 < domanic> and it gets them off github?
15:02 < mikolalysenko> or wherever you want
15:03 < mikolalysenko> it is pretty much exactly the same thing as component
15:03 < domanic> ah... and I suppose it doesn't store the hash anywhere...
15:03 < mikolalysenko> yeah
15:03 < mikolalysenko> and it has a brand new screwy configuration language
15:03 < mikolalysenko> called toml or whatever
15:03 < mikolalysenko> but other than that, it seems ok
15:04 < domanic> right so: it installs into a local folder, but can't load X@1 and X@2 into same application?
15:04 < mikolalysenko> no, it can
15:04 < mikolalysenko> it will install multiple versions if needed
15:04 < mikolalysenko> it uses exactly the same system as tjholowaychuk's component package manager essentially
15:05 < mikolalysenko> you give it git repos and it grabs modules by searching over the versions
15:05 < mikolalysenko> it isn't a bad idea, but the problem is if someone does a git rebase, a server goes down, someone mitms you, then it
                       will fail
15:05 < rowbit> Hourly usage stats: [developer: 0, free: 32]
15:05 < mikolalysenko> and then you end up in the sort of bad scenario, which is the same as development pre-npm, where people are scared to
                       use dependencies
15:06 < domanic> hmm, so it's TOML is basically just INI but different
15:06 < mikolalysenko> because they might break, and increase the rate of bit rot
15:06 < mikolalysenko> yeah, pretty much.  it looks like nih syndrome to me, but maybe there is a reason for it

15:07 -!- warbrett [~warbrett@72.44.240.228] has joined #stackvm
15:08 < mikolalysenko> I think it looks like an act of pure narcissism, though the same can be said for many efforts in creating programming
                       languages or reinventing ecosystems
15:09 < domanic> yeah... well at least he named it after himself so that is obvious!
15:09 < mikolalysenko> hahaha
15:10 < domanic> I think the better easy config lang that maps json is yamlish
15:10 < domanic> https://github.com/isaacs/yamlish
15:10 < domanic> yaml is too complex, yamlish is just the simple parts
15:11 < mikolalysenko> yeah, I don't know.
15:12 < mikolalysenko> this seems like one of those bikeshed problems that doesn't really matter, and where egos get really caught up in it
15:12 < domanic> yeah, exactly...
15:13 < guybrush> it does matter, it matters when everyone uses its own thing
15:13 < guybrush> its not critically but it matters imho
15:14 < domanic> mikolalysenko, what about having some sort of gpg style web of trust... where you basically request a user name by
                 requesting it from other users
15:15 < mikolalysenko> not sure how it would work
15:15 < domanic> or, have you heard of proof-of-stake?
15:16 < mikolalysenko> no, what does that mean?
15:17 < domanic> so one way to look at the POW is that all the nodes draw a straw to be the master node for that round
15:17 < domanic> in POS nodes are picked proportionally to their stake in the network (i.e. how many bitcoins they own, or in this case, how
                 many modules they published?)
15:18 < domanic> it picks say, 5 nodes, by the hash of the block (or similar) and they all sign the block
15:19 < domanic> any node can then look at that block, and confirm that those are the nodes that ought to have signed it
15:20 < domanic> brb... food

15:52 < jbenet> mikolalysenko + guybrush: see https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/19 - "Let's Stop Installing Packages" basic
                idea: mount the package registry using something like ipfs (or something similar)
15:54 < jbenet> mikolalysenko: namecoin is not the right solution IMO. We need only the ability transmit a small number of addresses of
                namespace roots (today, that's DNS anycast roots, tomorrow, it's hashes of different namespaces), and then do whatever
                within those, using self-certified naming. See SFS (old paper from mazieres, who wrote kademlia). IPFS aims to do it as
15:54 < jbenet> IPNS.
15:54 < mikolalysenko> interesting idea, though how do you would need to handle the diamond dependency/deduplication issue
15:54 < mikolalysenko> but you could maybe do that using a look up step on top of ipfs
15:55 < jbenet> mikolalysenko: just mount ../npm/package/packagename/version or ../npm/package/packagename@version
15:55 < mikolalysenko> hmm
15:55 < mikolalysenko> and the versions would be persistent/immutable?
15:55 < jbenet> and the things inside, like if A@1 includes C@1 and C@1 includes B@2, they each have links to the right one.
15:56 < jbenet> _nothing_ is duplicated (because of content addressing)
15:56 < jbenet> yep.
15:56 < jbenet> immutable versions.

16:01 < jbenet> ah, i see domanic was also discussing that stuff. o/
16:02 < jbenet> and since rust was mentioned: https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/22 -- automatic semver
16:04 < jbenet> domanic, on PoS, it seems to work, but idk. some crypto people are very skeptical. but nobody's found an attack.
16:05 < rowbit> Hourly usage stats: [developer: 1, free: 41]
16:18 < domanic> jbenet, yeah - it's not as obviously simple as PoW
16:20 < domanic> jbenet, mikolalysenko one thing that I think is important about modules is that you declare your deps via a flexible
                 version ranges that represent the interfaces that you can use, some interface changes are okay some are not, etc.
16:21 < domanic> being able to be crypto-precise would rule, but it would be a pain if you could no longer have the convienence of ranges.
16:21 < jbenet> domanic: no no, we can have ranges
16:21 < jbenet> that's what namespaces are for
16:21 < jbenet> namespace maps name -> hash
16:21 -!- brianloveswords [~brianlove@pool-108-14-35-12.nycmny.fios.verizon.net] has joined #stackvm
16:21 < domanic> ah right, so when I install I add a simlink into that version?
16:22 < jbenet> it's technically a hard link
16:22 < jbenet> because it's just the hash :)
16:22 < domanic> sure, well, a link either way
16:22 < jbenet> you could add a symlink too, and resolve it on demand
16:23 < jbenet> yeah sorry, dont mean to be pedantic, it's just that symlinks make everything really confusing sometimes
16:23 < domanic> so could I still update the dependencies in my 'install' of your module?
16:23 < jbenet> (so do hard links in kernel filesystems >.<)
16:24 < jbenet> domanic hm, good point, not without patching it.
16:25 < jbenet> which would technically be another version of the original module. so yeah, for that you probably want a symlink
16:25 < jbenet> could also see the semver resolution things happening with a mounted npm registry (that wraps ipfs, but does semver specific
                stuff)
16:25 < jbenet> like resolve ~1.2.3 or ^1.2.3 etc.
16:26 < domanic> If I mount my own namespace and do writes, is that publishes?
16:26 < domanic> because in that case it might be better to checkout into a mutable workspace, a la git
16:27 < domanic> at the end of the day, that is an application layer thing, not part of the fundementals of ipfs
16:31 < jbenet> domanic yeah, i think each pkg mgr would want to do a set of special things, so really just wrapping ipfs.
16:34 -!- _contrahax is now known as contrahax
16:34 < domanic> right, yeah either way, at the end of the day we probably need something to reliable to build this on top of, such as ipfs
16:35 < domanic> but due to the commitment to get that thing right, it needs to be more broardly useful than just a packagemanger.
16:35 < domanic> jbenet, by the way, i was wondering... what made you change the name from galactic file system to interplanetary file

17:00 < ogd> ok ill email stewart, how should i pitch it?
17:01 < ogd> discussion on the interplanetary filesystem with a cyberhobo?
17:01 < ogd> we should appeal to the cultural revolution angle though, that may be too dry
17:02 < jbenet> domanic: awesome, lmk dates you're here. I can offer up guest room for a couple days in a large shared house with a bunch of
                cool people.

17:20 < ogd> cool will do
17:21 < jbenet> and yeah, add more dat science specific stuff. Not sure he cares about science as much as he did before.
17:21 < jbenet> civics might be a good route too
17:21 < jbenet> or instead of "civics", empowering people with data about their life + world + government

18:28 < thealphanerd> Raynos / substack / ogd : do you guys have a prefered folder structure / work flow for building reusable browserify
                      modules?
18:29 < ogd> thealphanerd: for me 'reusable' and 'browserify' are implied by 'module' :)
18:29 < thealphanerd> :P
18:29 < ogd> thealphanerd: and in terms of folder structure no, i just have some js files that relative require each other, sometimes i have
             a subfolder for css, js etc
18:30 < thealphanerd> Ill rephrase& Im trying to develop a workflow that can be reused by developers to create widgets over at famo.us
18:30 < thealphanerd> we now have a common version of the platform
18:30 < thealphanerd> which will be released publicly via npm soon

                      with a cannonical design pattern
18:31 < ogd> thealphanerd: for me its npm init, npm install --save <dependencies, npm install --save-dev <development dependencies>, make
             sure `npm test` runs the test suite, make sure `npm start` starts a local dev server (if applicable)
18:32 -!- ceejbot [~ceejbot@50-1-57-179.static.sonic.net] has joined #stackvm
18:35 < thealphanerd> and then you can have different entry points for the app depending on if it is being run via node or npm right?
18:37 < ogd> thealphanerd: do you mean node or browserify?
18:37 < thealphanerd> a doy
18:37 < thealphanerd> yeah
18:37 < ogd> well sort of, you can use the 'browser' field in package.json to override dependencies

18:47 < thealphanerd> LOLOL
18:48 < Raynos> there's an upto date version for how we do uber templates and there is my personal one
18:48 < thealphanerd> we were using hogan on one of the last projects

18:57 < Raynos> thealphanerd: want to use jscs, not yet
18:58 < thealphanerd> fair enough& jshint still has some of the neccessary features, like scope based rules.  But the pluggable rules and
                      esprima based approach of jscs and eslint is very tempting
18:58 < Raynos> well jshint is about semantics, jscs is about style
18:59 < thealphanerd> jscs is still using esprima under the hood though
18:59 < thealphanerd> which creates some odd edge cases
18:59 < thealphanerd> cannot get single line if statements and indentation rules to play nice together

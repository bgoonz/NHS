00:15 < domanic> having one window is easy to think about
00:16 < domanic> but i guess that is something the home app can manage. whether
                 to open something as it's own window.
00:16 < pfraze> domanic: Ive been thinking we should do each app in its own
                window by default, rather than in webviews
00:17 < domanic> if webviews can have webviews and windows don't have special
                 privlidges... and we can sandbox them the same then it doesn't
                 really matter
00:18 < domanic> I think i would prefer a single window, with apps as tabs.
00:18 < pfraze> we ought to do one or the other
00:18 < pfraze> there are weird subtle differences
00:18 < domanic> if it's not a security question, then it's just a ux problem
00:19 < domanic> if multilpe aspects of the same thing (like inbox vs feed) are
                 separate windows
00:19 < domanic> that would be awkward i think... id do those as tabs.
00:20 < domanic> or like, it ought to be possible to take a tab and make it a
                 window
00:20 < pfraze> that's probably possible but it'll take a little work to do
00:21 < pfraze> the question I have is, what sort of experience we want to give
00:21 < pfraze> tabs are very browserish
00:21 < pfraze> windows are desktopish
00:21 < pfraze> I think I could make a case for either, but atm I was leaning
                toward the latter
00:22 < pfraze> if we do tabs, we could also do tabs w/o a navbar... just the
                tabs
00:23 < pfraze> no url input
00:26 -!- reqshark [~reqshark@72.235.67.12] has joined #scuttlebutt
00:34 < domanic> pfraze, this is a big UX thing, but it's not a big viability
                 thing
00:35 < domanic> we should go for something simple and consistent right now.
00:35 < domanic> I'd rather have tabs. windows would be quite awkward for me.
00:36 < domanic> I mean, this isn't something we should commit to yet.
00:36 < pfraze> we've got code for both written already
00:37 < pfraze> so we can easily switch between either
00:37 < domanic> yeah. or people can run their own tab/window/tiles/whatever
                 home app
00:37 < domanic> pfraze, more important Q rn, how to load default apps?
00:38 -!- joshbuddy [~josh@wikimedia/Joshbuddy] has joined #scuttlebutt
00:38 < domanic> I'm guessing that there is a ./defaults/app directory
00:38 < pfraze> yeah
00:38 < domanic> and on startup, the root process ensures that they are loaded
                 into the blobstore
00:38 < domanic> (that they exist in the blobstore)
00:39 < pfraze> yeah, and sets the names mapping to them
00:39 < domanic> ah, only if they arn't set already.

19:26 < pfraze> domanic: hey
19:26 < domanic> pfraze, houdy
19:27 < pfraze> domanic: published a few proposals in the issues, and a PR
                demonstrating a possible tabs solution
19:29 < pfraze> domanic: also tested, exposing node's `net` module via preload,
                and found an issue
19:29 < domanic> what happened?
19:30 < pfraze> exposed the 'net' module with `window.net = require('net')`,
                but 'net' does a require('dns') during operation, and 'dns'
                uses the `process` object... but `process` is not defined
                anymore outside of preload
19:30 < domanic> pfraze, this navbar is a separate window?
19:30 < pfraze> domanic: yeah. If you look at the diff, you'll see this is
                relatively trivial
19:31 < domanic> pfraze, what do you mean by "glue the frames into the navbar"?
19:32 < pfraze> domanic: we could listen to move events and move the other
                windows in concert, as if theyre glued together
19:32 < pfraze> same with resize
19:32 < domanic> oh right. hmm. can you hide and show a window too?
19:32 < pfraze> yes
19:32 < domanic> it seems this might work pretty well because then you can
                 break out a tab into a window without having to restart it.
19:32 < pfraze> yes
19:33 < pfraze> and we could also try out some unconventional WM ideas, if we
                want
19:42 < domanic> pfraze, yeah. though really, we want to give other people the
                 tools to hack on this
19:43 < pfraze> domanic: that's simple enough, just a matter of exposing RPC
                APIs
19:45 < pfraze> domanic: could you explain your response to #5 in more detail?
20:03 < domanic> pfraze, done
20:03 < pfraze> domanic: cool, reading
20:04 < pfraze> hmm
20:04 < pfraze> ok responding
20:07 < domanic> pfraze, about head off to catch up with a friend, talk to you
                 later!
20:07 < pfraze> domanic: ok, are you going to be back on tonight?
20:09 < domanic> yeah, should be
20:09 < pfraze> domanic: ok cool, if doing get back on, send me a suggestion of
                some work I can do during the day, I'm a bit blocked
20:09 < pfraze> if you dont*
20:11 < domanic> ahdinosaur wants api documentation!
20:11 < pfraze> for sbot?
20:11 < domanic> yeah
20:12 < domanic> the api methods, cli too
20:12 < pfraze> ok, that's a good idea
20:12 < pfraze> ah yeah, I was thinking about working on the cli a bit
20:12 < pfraze> since it has no live help

17:35 < mafintosh> domanic: late saturday
17:35 < domanic> 9:34 am sunday here
17:35 < mafintosh> domanic: you're 10 hours ahead of me
17:36 < domanic> i will be flying on tuesday (your monday) but we can do call
                 right now
17:37 < mafintosh> domanic: do you have time in 9-10 hours from now? about to
                   go to bed
17:37 < mafintosh> i'm pretty flexible tomorrow
17:38 < domanic> mafintosh, maybe or i can get up early tomorrow
17:38 < domanic> probably tomorrow morning will be slightly easier for me
17:38 < mafintosh> domanic: that also works for me. how about 9am tomorrow your
                   time?
17:39 < domanic> mafintosh, yup that would be fine.
17:39 < mafintosh> thats in 23h 20 mins ish
17:39 < mafintosh> domanic: perfect - shouldn't take long
17:41 < domanic> mafintosh, sweet as.
17:43 < substack> does ssb have any URL protocol scheme or a url scheme for the
                  http relays?
17:44 < substack> working on a spec for html versioning and I want to make sure
                  the basic approach will work for ipfs, webtorrent, and ssb if
                  possible
17:44 < pfraze> substack: we're sorta figuring that out right now. domanic,
                that PR youre doing did the blob: scheme, what are you thinking
                atm?
17:45 < pfraze> substack: you got a draft?
17:45 < domanic> substack, pfraze I don't think this applies to anything we are
                 working on
17:46 < domanic> we just have <base64 hashes>.sha256
17:46 < domanic> that is the content. simple to convert to ipfs hashes
17:46 < pfraze> well, we have the sigils, and we're probably going to have a
                scheme
17:47 < substack> ok that will probably work
17:48 < substack> and the IDs are the hashes of a public key or the public key
                  itself?
17:48 < pfraze> yeah
17:48 < substack> great
17:50 < domanic> pfraze,
https://github.com/ssbc/brickhouse/issues/5#issuecomment-139822100
17:50 < substack> what do you think about putting an ssb:// protocol prefix in
                  front of those hashes?
17:50 < substack> (in some contexts)
17:50 < domanic> substack, ids are <public key>.ed25519
17:50 < domanic> substack, sorry, ID = "@<public key>.ed25519"
17:50 < substack> internally yes, but what about externally?
17:51 < domanic> substack, we don't have an http interface, except locally to
                 load blobs.
17:51 < substack> that's fine
17:51 < substack> I'm making an application loader using service workers to
                  intercept different protocols
17:52 < substack> so ipfs: magnet: etc to distinguish the protocols
17:52 < pfraze> domanic: in the current brickhouse build, we're using ssb:, do
                you think there's any problem committing to that?
17:53 < domanic> pfraze, that is only blobs though. lets just make that
                 blob:<hash>
17:53 < domanic> I want to decouple ssb from brickhouse
17:54 < substack> the main purpose of the protocols for my piece will be to
                  figure out which piece of code should trigger loading the
                  resource
17:56 < pfraze> substack: so yeah it looks like we're going to create a blob:
                scheme, like domanic describes
17:56 < pfraze> and we use electron's protocol registration api to route that
                to an http server
17:56 < pfraze> so that, blob:<hash> -> http://localhost:7777/<hash>
17:57 < pfraze> do you need more detail about the blob: scheme format?
17:58 < substack> I guess blob: just might be slightly ambiguous when
                  encountered in an arbitrary webapp
17:58 < pfraze> substack: what are you thinking?
17:59 < substack> there is already one called blob: in
                  https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml
17:59 < pfraze> ah, hmm
17:59 < pfraze> domanic: what are your thoughts on that
18:02 < domanic> that is a good point
18:02 < domanic> pfraze, or maybe it should be brkhs
18:02 < domanic> pfraze,  brkhs:
18:02 < pfraze> mmm
18:03 < pfraze> hash: isnt taken yet
18:03 < substack> it's probably better to have something less generic
18:03 < substack> something that will turn up a spec when you put it in a
                  search engine
18:04 < pfraze> yeah. I like brick: more than brkhs:
18:04 < substack> brick: sounds cool
18:04 < pfraze> domanic: ^
18:05 < domanic> pfraze, brick: is good
18:05 < pfraze> ok, format is... <base64-hash>.<algo> ?
18:05 < domanic> yes
18:06 < pfraze> ok, substack, you need any more info?
18:06 < substack> nope, that's it
18:06 < substack> thanks!
18:06 < pfraze> cool
18:06 < substack> it can be whatever you want after the protocol part, just
                  need a good way to namespace these different loaders
18:06 < pfraze> yeah
18:30 < pfraze> domanic: my point about the installer/viewer, only makes sense
                if we're going to make the review/audit network core
18:31 < pfraze> if we want to back up a little bit, the installer just needs a
                way to evaluate bundle security
18:32 < pfraze> or, I guess, not -- we can just show the changes that will
                occur and let the user decide
18:32 < domanic> pfraze, sure. but the audit tools we'll need will be a big
                 deal. lets of wrok there
18:32 < pfraze> yeah
18:33 < pfraze> in the short term we can use the sort of "soft" audit network
                which exists, which is that youre just installing bundles that
                friends/orgs publish
18:46 < domanic> pfraze, we should talk about how a robust audit network would
                 work, and just make sure we *could* build that
18:46 < domanic> but just build something really simple that we can use just now

20:51 < pfraze> domanic: hey check this thing out http://webintents.org/
20:51 < pfraze> this proposal died on the vine
21:17 < domanic> pfraze, hey, idea: for easy services we can just use
                 browser-window with show:false option
21:18 -!- joshbuddy [~josh@wikimedia/Joshbuddy] has quit [Quit: joshbuddy]
21:21 < pfraze> domanic: ah yeah, that works, then we get the sandbox still
21:21 -!- joshbuddy [~josh@wikimedia/Joshbuddy] has joined #scuttlebutt
21:21 < domanic> yeah, and i think we need to seek focus, and simplicity,
                 otherwise this browser idea will sprawl out of control
21:22 < pfraze> yeah
21:22 < domanic> we need to enable anything but not build it if possible
21:22 < pfraze> yes that's spot on
21:25 < pfraze> domanic: really the rpc thing is about runtime extensibility
                that we can build on
21:25 < pfraze> it's not *plugins*, but it's a similar spirit
21:27 < pfraze> and it takes decision-making out of core, which is I think your
                point earlier about installable apps helping with
                decision-making
21:28 < domanic> yes yes yes
21:29 < domanic> then we have less need to agree on direction before hand, and
                 can experiment and test
21:29 < pfraze> yeah
21:29 < domanic> finding agreement is hard enough with just you and I
21:30 < pfraze> right
21:33 < pfraze> even something like intents could be done with named apps and
                rpc
21:35 < pfraze> domanic: so will an RPC consumer specify a name?
21:35 < pfraze> rpc('toaster')
21:35 < pfraze> and then whatever youve got at toaster, that's what it gets?
21:36 < pfraze> if we have the consumer specify the manifest, we can use that
                manifest as the permissions request, right?
21:37 < pfraze> huh, what if we had the rpc provider describe a permissions
                request?
21:37 < domanic> pfraze, yeah i think so. and it would be possible to remap
                 that, so that it's possible to have multiple toaster apps
21:37 < pfraze> var mytoaster = rpc('toaster', { setToastLevel: 'async',
                forcePop: 'async' })
21:37 < pfraze> you do that, the toaster app gets an event, like...
21:38 < pfraze> rpc.on('requestAccess', function (perms) { /* perms = {
                setToastLevel, forcePop } */ })
21:38 < pfraze> and toaster did something like
21:39 -!- mdik [~mdik@x4d0c6dd2.dyn.telefonica.de] has joined #scuttlebutt
21:39 < pfraze> if ('forcePop' in perms) rpc.explain("the consumer wants to
                control the toaster completely") }
21:40 < pfraze> hm. may not be worth it
21:41 < pfraze> but.... we *could* put the access-permission decision in the
                hands of the provider
21:43 < pfraze> should rpc permissions be enforced in core, or userland?

22:33 < pfraze> substack: I like this
22:33 < substack> thanks!
22:34 < pfraze> htmlbin is probably half way there yeah?
22:34 < substack> somewhat
22:34 < substack> I'm going to use this spec to implement the next version of
                  hyperboot
22:34 < pfraze> domanic: ^ what do you think of using this
22:37 < pfraze> substack: is there a way we could put the signature inline,
                instead of as a link?
22:37 < pfraze> maybe a data-uri
22:37 < substack> nope!
22:37 < pfraze> oh right
22:37 < pfraze> that'd affect the signature
22:37 < substack> exactly
22:37 < substack> a bit unfortunate, but the alternatives are crappy
22:38 < pfraze> hmmmmmm shoot, yeah
22:38 < pfraze> I mean, you could append the signature to the end in a <!-- -->
22:38 < pfraze> and strip that to recompute and check the sig...
22:39 < substack> that's true
22:39 < substack> also on github if you want to open a thread about that idea
                  https://github.com/substack/html-version-spec
22:39 < pfraze> ok
22:41 < substack> I'm very open to this idea
22:41 < substack> because that signature is the only piece of non-inline content
22:42 < pfraze> yeah
22:55 < pfraze> substack: do you know, is it possible to inline fonts in HTML?
23:03 < substack> I'm looking
23:03 < pfraze> yeah Im not seeing that anywhere
23:04 < substack> probably possible with data uris
23:04 < pfraze> yeah
23:04 < substack> yes it looks possible
23:08 < pfraze> substack: youre going to need to parse the html with your
                hyperboot tools to read and update the version info, right?
23:09 -!- joshbuddy [~josh@wikimedia/Joshbuddy] has joined #scuttlebutt
23:11 < domanic> substack, pfraze would it be easier to put the signature FIRST
                 instead of last
23:11 < pfraze> oh yeah?
23:14 < substack> pfraze: for publishing, yes
23:15 < substack> domanic: I'm not sure but if the signature is at the end then
                  you don't need to buffer the entire html doc into memory
                  first with a streaming signature implementation
23:16 < substack> but using crypto_sign_detached() it won't matter
23:16 < domanic> substack, html docs arn't really that big
23:16 < substack> with all assets inline
23:17 < substack> I can imagine some html apps getting very big in the future
23:17 < substack> unity is hundreds of megabytes of js
23:29 < domanic> substack, it would be better for the index to include deps by
                 their hash
23:30 < domanic> the url would include a hash, encoded in some format
23:30 < domanic> and the signing service worker would check it did have this
                 hash, or error.
23:31 < domanic> then the index.html is the only part that actually needs a
                 signature, provided that every resource is id'd by hash
23:31 < domanic> then the index.html could be quite small, and that would make
                 it easy to update the app.
23:32 < substack> true
23:34 < substack> domanic: some of that is built into the browser I learned
                  recently
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/
23:36 < substack> <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
                  content="script-src
                  'sha256-qznLcsROx4GACP2dm0UCKCzCG-HiZ1guq6ZZDob_Tng='">
23:36 < domanic> substack, oh that is great news!
23:37 < domanic> how does the script tag specify what the hash should be?
23:37 < substack> you do that in an http header or a meta tag like I just posted
23:37 < substack> CSP is a white-list
23:38 < substack> so a script with the hash of
                  qznLcsROx4GACP2dm0UCKCzCG-HiZ1guq6ZZDob_Tng= is allowed to be
                  on the page
23:38 < substack> and all other scripts are not allowed
23:38 < substack> you can have multiple allowed scripts of course
23:39 < domanic> oh, but it's not tied to a particular script. ugly but has
                 what you need basically
23:55 < domanic> pfraze, substack this is pretty interesting!

Day changed to 13 Sep 2015
00:03 < pfraze> domanic: thoughts on rpc-names instead of namesdb?
00:04 < domanic> in my pr it's apps db
00:04 < pfraze> ok instead of appsdb
00:04 < substack> that website isn't loading for me, some requirejs timeout
00:07 < domanic> pfraze, serviceDB?
00:07 < domanic> i think apps is fine though
00:08 < pfraze> domanic: no I dont have a problem with the semantic
00:08 < pfraze> appsdb maps a name -> app hash
00:08 < domanic> names is too generic, rpc-names is not specific enough
00:08 < pfraze> ok well so, the point is to figure out what `rpc(name)` maps to
                right?
00:10 < domanic> it's not *just* that
00:12 < pfraze> it also controls the "install" state... yeah?
00:12 < pfraze> anything else?
00:14 < domanic> it points to the apps to load first (eg, home)
00:15 < pfraze> Im just wondering if itd be simpler to keep an in-memory
                registry of rpc targets that reflects the active scripts
00:15 < pfraze> and then a script could export multiple different rpc names
00:15 < domanic> we need ti to be persistent
00:16 < domanic> pfraze, do we really want a script to have mulitple apis? it
                 could just use nested objects
00:17 < pfraze> domanic: well, my thinking is it might be relevant for common
                apis that the user wants to have multiple providers for
00:17 < domanic> for example?
00:18 < pfraze> mm, rpc('files') for instance
00:20 < domanic> pfraze, what does the freezeSnapshot do? that saves the
                 current dev version of the files you are editing?
00:21 < pfraze> domanic: yep, stores it in multiblob and gives you the hash

18:13 < domanic> I'll be in oakland oct12th-nov9
18:13 < domanic> although, that was longer than i had thought though
18:13 < pfraze> yeah that's pretty long
18:13 < pfraze> who are you crashing with?
18:17 < domanic> pfraze, I'm gonna stay with substack
18:17 < domanic> I might go for a walkabout at the end of that trip though, I
                 had thought it was gonna be 3 weeks, with more time in portland
18:17 < mafintosh> thanks for the feedback - i'll ping you both when i have the
                   next iteration ready
18:17 < pfraze> mafintosh: +1
18:18 < domanic> but somehow when the flights arrived they where not quite the
                 same. anyway, no matter.
18:18 < mafintosh> then we can try streaming stuff over the internet \o/
18:18 < pfraze> domanic: yeah, what dates should I aim for?
18:18 < domanic> pfraze, go for the start of that range
18:18 < domanic> oh yeah, there will be a bunch of enspiral people in town at
                 the 12th
18:19 < domanic> total coincidence!
18:19 < domanic> but given they are very enthusiastic about ssb they would be
                 good for you to meet
18:20 < pfraze> nice, yeah
18:23 < domanic> pfraze, in muxrpccli you have the usage command
18:23 < pfraze> domanic: yeah
18:23 < domanic> which gives usage per cmd... but would it be easier to just a
                 {cmd: string} structure?
18:24 < pfraze> that'd probably work too
18:25 < domanic> at least, it should automatically combine the lines instead of
                 requiring the sender to write the code that sends all the
                 usuage
18:25 < domanic> because we'll be lazy about that.
18:25 < pfraze> domanic: v
18:25 < pfraze> lol
18:25 < pfraze> https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/pull/234
18:26 < pfraze> it looks like the usage.js I have in there is going to be
                pretty common
18:27 < domanic> we already have much of the information in the usage because
                 of the manifest
18:27 < domanic> we just need the descriptions
18:27 < pfraze> the issue is just where that info comes from, right?
18:27 < domanic> yeah, and can we write less code
18:28 < pfraze> yeah, the app needs to provide the descriptions somewhere
18:28 < pfraze> like, manifests are symmetrically maintained, probably - both
                rpc client and server have a copy
18:28 < pfraze> they have been so far
18:29 < domanic> pfraze, idea: since it's hard to write text in JSON
18:29 < domanic> what if the manifest are in markdown
18:29 < domanic> ## command
18:29 < domanic> explainations....
18:29 < pfraze> humm
18:29 < domanic> ## next commend
18:29 < domanic> etc
18:29 < pfraze> basically theyre parseable docs
18:29 < pfraze> I think that's a good idea. We might also look at yaml
18:30 < pfraze> yaml is very markdown-like, but has clear parsing rules
18:30 < domanic> yeah. although yaml is actually a massive spec
18:30 < pfraze> that's true
18:30 < domanic> (json is a valid subset)
18:30 < pfraze> heh
18:30 < domanic> although this is good: https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlish
18:31 < domanic> it's just a subset that maps to json
18:31 < pfraze> that's basically what we need
18:31 < pfraze> we can expand on the subset a bit
18:32 < domanic> it would be good to write the document as readable text
18:32 < domanic> which is why i suggest markdown
18:32 < domanic> could be:
18:32 < domanic> # api name
18:32 < pfraze> yeah, markdown could be regular enough for us
18:32 < domanic> short api description (first line)
18:32 < domanic> details....
18:32 < pfraze> actually I think this is a very good idea
18:32 < domanic> ## command name
18:32 < domanic> short description (first line)
18:33 < domanic> rest of details for command name...
18:33 < domanic> markdown already has nesting # ## ### #### etc
18:33 < pfraze> domanic: hey we should also look at how that BEP exchange works
18:33 < pfraze> at some point, we're going to need to manage compatibility
                between apps

18:35 < pfraze> domanic: I have to go babysit my nieces
18:35 < pfraze> so I'll be back on... no later than 3 hours from now
18:35 < domanic> pfraze, muxrpc already handles that more or less
18:35 < pfraze> domanic: I guess the notfound event
18:36 < pfraze> error*
18:36 < pfraze> ok bbl

18:51 < mafintosh> domanic this is the hashing scheme btw used in the streaming
                   atm, https://gist.github.com/mafintosh/7e8bdde9a51ec6dfd2ab
                   (forgot to mention that)
18:52 < domanic> mafintosh, that is the hash for a leaf?
18:53 < mafintosh> domanic: yea (numeric index is the block index, 1, 2, 3, ...)
18:53 < mafintosh> i mean 0, 2, 4, 6 ofcourse
18:53 < mafintosh> since the even numbers are the leaves
18:56 < mafintosh> domanic: not sure if its needed to have the numeric index in
                   there
18:57 < domanic> hmm... i'm not sure if this is the best way
18:57 < domanic> what about leaf = (sig, seq, hash(previous_hashes....),
                 hash(data_block))
18:58 < domanic> sig signs the rest of the object it's in.
18:58 < domanic> this also means it's always a fixed size
18:58 < mafintosh> domanic: is that important for hash input?
18:59 < domanic> it just makes the protocol simpler, and does remove possible
                 security holes, that can arise from sending an unexpected
                 amount of data
19:00 < domanic> it means you can manage memory better, because you can
                 preallocate n*block_size and you can keep them in flat arrays
                 etc
19:01 < domanic> mafintosh, i don't quite understand the thing in your gist. is
                 this what i get when I ask for a block's hash? is this what
                 gets signed?
19:03 < mafintosh> domanic: its the leaf hash currently
19:03 < mafintosh> domanic: and that gets signed as well
19:06 < domanic> mafintosh, so the leaf hash contains all the preceding hashes
                 in it's tree?
19:06 < mafintosh> domanic: the previous roots needed to verify the entire
                   previous tree yea
19:08 < domanic> hmm, so if they are included like this, do you need to request
                 them too?
19:10 < mafintosh> domanic: yea i do that as well
19:10 < mafintosh> if you don't have them already
19:10 < domanic> right, but if you have this block then you'll ready have them,
                 obviously
19:11 < domanic> it also means that these hashes are duplicated in each block
                 that depends on them.
19:13 < mafintosh> domanic: hmm how else would you do it?
19:13 < mafintosh> not sure we're talking about the same thing :)
19:14 < domanic> not sure either
             you for letting me know!

                 publishing picture
20:39 <substack> or bittorrent under bep44 for that matter, or ordinary http to
                 some degree
20:42 <substack> a webapp 1) uses service workers to verify content it has
                 already received and verified 2) contains the list of all
                 known versions 3) contains a url (http, ipfs, or magnet) to a
                 document that is the hash of the new version

19:49 <jjjohnny> whcich keyboot
19:49 <jjjohnny> err
19:49 <jjjohnny> which keyboot
19:50 <jjjohnny> the app systems needs two key things
19:50 <jjjohnny> https for pay, and an identy wallet
 ~substack@104.131.0.235 (freenode)
19:52 <jjjohnny> the new folkstack site is gonna use keyboot
19:53 <jjjohnny> needs to show private keys on request
19:53 <jjjohnny> and have optional passphrase encryption
19:54 <jjjohnny> long pass phrases
19:54 <jjjohnny> your favorite lyric, stanza, theorem or some shit
19:55 <jjjohnny> but passphrase encryption is a must, as is showing / exporting
                 the private key
19:55 <jjjohnny> that way I can move my identity from device to device
19:55 <jjjohnny> download a qr file
19:56 <jjjohnny> we're gonna distribute free media on our tours, with callbacks
                 to our web
19:57 <jjjohnny> qr codes for content, links to various donation platforma,
                 bitcoin of course
19:59 <jjjohnny> movement starting
19:59 <jjjohnny> inertial breakthru detected
19:59 <jjjohnny> we could make our llaser etched qr code ids for da web
20:00 <jjjohnny> http://www.offlinewallets.com/images/bitcoin-wood-wallet.jpg
20:18 <jjjohnny> also, export keyboot identity to a CLI module...
20:18 <jjjohnny> which see which keyboot
20:24 <jjjohnny> prototyping browser apps on the CLI will be sweet
20:25 <jjjohnny> the dream of normalization will have become reality

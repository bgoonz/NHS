03:51 < jjjohnny> web apps

03:52 < jjjohnny> apps that connect to each other

03:52 < jjjohnny> via a network of tubes

03:52 < jjjohnny> these tubes are filled with microtubes

03:53 < jjjohnny> microtubes look like hairs

03:53 < jjjohnny> the internet if tubes looks like up your nose

03:54 < jjjohnny> the microtubes run perpendicular to the macro tubes

03:54 < jjjohnny> thus the view down an inter tube of net looks like a spoked wheel, that goes on forever out of view, down the tube

03:55 < jjjohnny> a spoked wheel animated by the ghost of salvador dali

03:55 < jjjohnny> 

03:55 < jjjohnny> that is the fundamentally the view of the "internet of webs",
                  or the "web all the things" meme

03:56 < jjjohnny> i am a spider that is not a spider but all spiders, and you
                  are swine

03:57 < jjjohnny> that is why I can tell you these things, pig

03:57 < jjjohnny> and why you better believe them, hog, before your time starts
                  cooking

03:58 < jjjohnny> here let me spin your a story

03:59 < jjjohnny> its called the story of the facts i delivered to your moments
                  ago

03:59 < jjjohnny> and i shall spin it into a single image this time, instead of words, becuz you look at me kinda dumb

03:59 < jjjohnny> i will summon the web spell, and pull as much of the web as I want out of my device, which is my very large ass

03:59 < jjjohnny> now, look at my web

04:00 < jjjohnny> thats is what it looks like down an internet tubes the long
                  way

04:00 < jjjohnny> this is a two dimension image, you see, this web is an
                  isomorph

04:01 < jjjohnny> well, a 2d image broken into fractal animation by the wind of
                  the ghost of dali

04:01 < jjjohnny> do you smell thunder, swine?

04:03  * jjjohnny calls this story charletans' webs'

04:04 < jjjohnny> which can be logically translated to the contents of those
                  webs

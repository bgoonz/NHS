12:13 < mikolalysenko> I thought about maybe adding another example using cwise
12:13 < ogd> booyea more awesome live demos won't hurt
12:14 < ogd> mikolalysenko: also the dark green font color used in some of the slides might be hard to read on a projector
12:14 < mikolalysenko> ogd: good point, I will fix it
12:15 -!- quijote [~quijote@31.16.190.232] has joined #stackvm
12:15 < mikolalysenko> I think I need to revisit how mouse movements are handled in game shell
12:16 < mikolalysenko> I am also not sure that I am handling all the different blur/focus loss situations correctly
12:17 < mikolalysenko> one problem I had in early versions was a "sticky key" issue, where sometimes the shell would get a keydown but never
                       the matching keyup event
12:17 < mikolalysenko> so the button would get stuck in a down state
12:17 < mikolalysenko> the way I tried to fix this was by clearing all the down keys whenever the window loses focus
12:17 < mikolalysenko> but sometimes the window loses focus without firing a blur event...
12:17 < ogd> yea i ran into that w/ keydown https://github.com/maxogden/keydown/blob/master/index.js
12:18 < mikolalysenko> like when you press ctrl/meta + some browser button
12:19 < mikolalysenko> I managed to avoid most of those issues by doing the event.preventDefaults() but it isn't perfect
12:19 < mikolalysenko> also if you have stuff like text boxes in the page or other elements, clicking on them messes up the keystate since
                       it doesn't always trigger a blur
12:20 < mikolalysenko> I have a sinking feeling that I am doing something in there completely wrong, but I don't understand it well enough
12:23 < mikolalysenko> another issue is with rapid keypresses
12:23 < mikolalysenko> if you tap a button multiple times per frame, then if you are polling you might miss the key press
12:23 < mikolalysenko> the way I fixed this was by keeping a counter for each button and the number of times it was pressed/released
12:24 < mikolalysenko> then clearing that counter at the start of each tick
12:24 < mikolalysenko> but maybe a better solution is to actually maintain a persistent array for all the key states
12:24 < ogd> also to avoid potential controversy you might wanna consider using an image that doesnt originate from playboy (i know its used
             in tons of papers). i've seen people flip out at conferences for things perceived as reinforcing sexism even though they arent
             intended as such
12:25 < mikolalysenko> ogd: yeah, that's something I would like to avoid
12:26 < ogd> use cats, everyone loves cats
12:26 < mikolalysenko> ogd: yeah...  though fixing it is going to be a big pain since I will have to update a ton of modules
12:27 < mikolalysenko> maybe I should just deprecate the "lena" repository
12:27 < ogd> publish a new patch version that changes it to a cat haha
12:28 < mikolalysenko> hmm... does that break semver?
12:28 < mikolalysenko> deprecate is probably the right thing to do I think
12:28 < mikolalysenko> but before that I have to find a suitable replacement image

12:29 < mikolalysenko> fixing all of this is gonna take a day or two though, and so I probably won't get to it for a bit
12:29 < ogd> here are some bsd licensed cats https://github.com/maxogden/cats
12:30 < ogd> techincally if you found a cat named lena you could add it and justify it as a bug fix
12:30 < ogd> :P
12:32 < mikolalysenko> I think I will eventually make a repository of test images, excluding lena
12:32 < mikolalysenko> where you do something like require("example-image/peppers") and get an appropriate test image

13:09 < chrisdickinson> mafintosh: memory issues? i'd use npm.im/heapdump + chrome dev tools
13:09 < chrisdickinson> if you require that module anywhere in your code, if you `kill -s USR3` your process, it'll produce a heapdump file
                        that can be loaded in chrome dev tools profile pane
13:09 < chrisdickinson> which is really rad -- it can even show you comparison views (what objects were allocated between these two heap
                        dumps), dominators (what objects contain most paths through to root), etc

                        the process of writing a heapdump, nothing happens, and it doesn't let you know that nothing is happening :P

14:24 < chrisdickinson> ogd: is the game shell executing in a frame?
14:27 < chrisdickinson> also, re stickiness when focus drops out of the window, use `window.addEventListener(<eventName>, function(){})`
                        (vs. an element) -- it can catch things like "mousedown" outside of the window iirc

11:44 < mikolalysenko> that's actually kind of neat
11:45 < mikolalysenko> I think that people should use solvers and other technologies to make things more declarative and efficient
11:46 < mikolalysenko> but it would be nice if the solvers was handled as a separate module, rather than being reimplemented in the package
                       manager itself...
11:48 < mikolalysenko> it would be nice if there were good solvers available on npm with simple interfaces
11:53 < Domenic_> npm needs a solver badly
11:54 < Domenic_> To do up-front deduping

12:08 < ogd> hmm why doesnt clicking on the bunny change focus to the iframe containing said bunny http://requirebin.com/?gist=11538855
12:10 < mikolalysenko> ogd: hmm, not sure
12:11 < ogd> mikolalysenko: hey whats your web rebels talk gonna be on?
12:11 < ogd> mikolalysenko: mine will largely be about browserify
12:11 < mikolalysenko> ogd: maybe I am doing something stupid in game-shell, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to handle blur events
                       and so on
12:11 < mikolalysenko> ogd: ndarrays
12:11 < ogd> mikolalysenko: w00t!
12:12 < mikolalysenko> ogd: here is the slide deck http://mikolalysenko.github.io/ndarray-presentation/
12:12 < mikolalysenko> I have made a few modifications since then, and there are some bugs in the version on github
12:13 < mikolalysenko> I thought about maybe adding another example using cwise
12:13 < ogd> booyea more awesome live demos won't hurt
12:14 < ogd> mikolalysenko: also the dark green font color used in some of the slides might be hard to read on a projector
12:14 < mikolalysenko> ogd: good point, I will fix it
12:15 -!- quijote [~quijote@31.16.190.232] has joined #stackvm
12:15 < mikolalysenko> I think I need to revisit how mouse movements are handled in game shell
12:16 < mikolalysenko> I am also not sure that I am handling all the different blur/focus loss situations correctly
12:17 < mikolalysenko> one problem I had in early versions was a "sticky key" issue, where sometimes the shell would get a keydown but never
                       the matching keyup event
12:17 < mikolalysenko> so the button would get stuck in a down state
12:17 < mikolalysenko> the way I tried to fix this was by clearing all the down keys whenever the window loses focus
12:17 < mikolalysenko> but sometimes the window loses focus without firing a blur event...
12:17 < ogd> yea i ran into that w/ keydown https://github.com/maxogden/keydown/blob/master/index.js
12:18 < mikolalysenko> like when you press ctrl/meta + some browser button
12:19 < mikolalysenko> I managed to avoid most of those issues by doing the event.preventDefaults() but it isn't perfect
12:19 < mikolalysenko> also if you have stuff like text boxes in the page or other elements, clicking on them messes up the keystate since
                       it doesn't always trigger a blur
12:20 < mikolalysenko> I have a sinking feeling that I am doing something in there completely wrong, but I don't understand it well enough
12:23 < mikolalysenko> another issue is with rapid keypresses
12:23 < mikolalysenko> if you tap a button multiple times per frame, then if you are polling you might miss the key press
12:23 < mikolalysenko> the way I fixed this was by keeping a counter for each button and the number of times it was pressed/released
12:24 < mikolalysenko> then clearing that counter at the start of each tick
12:24 < mikolalysenko> but maybe a better solution is to actually maintain a persistent array for all the key states
12:24 < ogd> also to avoid potential controversy you might wanna consider using an image that doesnt originate from playboy (i know its used
             in tons of papers). i've seen people flip out at conferences for things perceived as reinforcing sexism even though they arent
             intended as such
12:25 < mikolalysenko> ogd: yeah, that's something I would like to avoid
12:26 < ogd> use cats, everyone loves cats
12:26 < mikolalysenko> ogd: yeah...  though fixing it is going to be a big pain since I will have to update a ton of modules
12:27 < mikolalysenko> maybe I should just deprecate the "lena" repository
12:27 < ogd> publish a new patch version that changes it to a cat haha
12:28 < mikolalysenko> hmm... does that break semver?
12:28 < mikolalysenko> deprecate is probably the right thing to do I think
12:28 < mikolalysenko> but before that I have to find a suitable replacement image

12:30 < ogd> techincally if you found a cat named lena you could add it and justify it as a bug fix
12:30 < ogd> :P
12:32 < mikolalysenko> I think I will eventually make a repository of test images, excluding lena
12:32 < mikolalysenko> where you do something like require("example-image/peppers") and get an appropriate test image

### what it is to us

crypto currencies allow individuals and non governmental organization to be creative with their commerce.  Commerce was once defined as any exchange between people. Today, commerce is purely... commercial, and u know what commercial means, if ur using a site called INDIE-gog.  Crypto currency offer us a way to redefine, or perhaps retrodefine, what commerce is.  

Crypto Cards:  the future is retro! (retro motif?)

Today, the strict use of state controlled currencies, or fiat currencies, force all forms of commerce the pigeonhole of debt.

SCENE: this project aims to get you into crypto currencies
SCENE:
friends hanging out talking CCCs, talking about how they use their CCC communities.
friend enters with a pack of crypto cards!  yay!

open source
because CCs are open source, we are taking them to the next level.  We're creating cryptocards, a fun way of getting into cryto currencies. Cards represent a number of actual crypto coins, which can be traded.  The cards also  have information about that crypto coin, such as why it is special, or what it represents.  All information and artwork will be original to this project.  

what we are doing is sending you a pack of crypto currencies

##  modular acrhiecture for the web applications

This is the repo for a book thing, to be published by leanpub.  

The rules are simple.  Chapters, written in markdown, go the manuscript folder.  Then add the file name of the chapter to manuscript/book.txt.

For raw content, put it in the top level or some other directory, and from there it will be edited into the manuscript.

#Campaign & Video Ideas

There are at least three directoon we can take with video/campaign:

1. we're starting a radical thing in public education,
2. we're running a program at Met West High School
3. we make a humble video about bringing programming to the lower bottoms, and point to an interactive educational we made.  

##if the third: monthlong hackathon
IDEA:  wizards game redux, set in a short story.  A story about getting a job lol.

##If the second
then we do some demos at Met West, a mini hackathon, and some basic open sessions between now and campaign launch.  We'll record video of these events to use in the video.

This will also help us attract actual students.

demo ideas:
a dramatic introduction and dmemonstration of none other than a google glasses
quadcopter coding
audio/video muxing
amazing feats of shell scripting
interactive: discussion about tehcnology ad the future

the hackathon may need to be somewhat directed.  Maybe a unified effort to build some loosely coupled thing.
Idea:  they make websites that link back and forth and create an equsisite corpse.
idea:  they make a text messages app that uses some API
Idea: 

##If the first direction
Then we focus on ideas and ideals, and expose the education system through a filter radical.
IDEA:  we describe how this open source thing will work, how it will benefit, what are its goals.
IDEA:  we act like we're training the anti-fascists of the future lol
IDEA:  Setting: Middle-East Oakland.  Kids in small fenced playpens, which is actually their playground. A gorilla tech art scene pops up other side of teh fence one day for real.  Cut to military / black squadron looking leader, calling for drones and cameras cyber stuff.  Cut to scene of students hacking same.
IDEA: 





###old ideas:

There are a few ways this could go.

* 3rd person Doc style, talking about the people, school, ideas, and goals.
* 1st person straight style, with same talking points.
* Dress up as wizards, have fun, emphasize magic, be bullish on technology and scorn the lack of digital fun and programming in schools.

Whatever the case, ideas and content for the video goes here, go:

##Narrative
Technology and the internet are changing everything around us.

Every industry, every product, every system is in some way advanced through new technology.

And what is at the root of modern technology?  Computer Programming.

And that is why our public schools are so heavily invested in teaching it--

You mean, they aren't teaching programming, digital literacy, and internet technology in the public schools?

Q: What resources does your school for teaching computer programming and digital literacy?

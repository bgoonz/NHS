#Campaign & Proposal
This doc is for ideas and stuff that should go into the campaign to fund this project...

For instance:

##pre-campaign and tax-deductible fundraising
The school itself, and the Big Picture organization can accept tax-deductible donations, and year end is the time to make those.

Possibly:  create a simple online pay portal (using stripe) for the school to receive donations for the program, and during the month of december, promote that for fundraising.  Maybe need to create an "official" campaign drive for the school.  Aside from year-end tax deducting, this campaign does not have to be short run.

At the same time (December), document and share the process of founding the program, including materials, demos, interviews, and the creation of the crowd funding campaign. Use this as a ramp for the crowd funding campaign.  

##Foci
Should the campaign focus on the creation of the wizard school, and feature Met West?
Should it focus on Met West, and feature the wizard school?
Should we expand the definition of what the program is to provide, from programming and digital literacy, to digital arts and science?  To say that digital and coding skills will be taught through music, games, and art is touching on the deficiency of creative programs as well as digital ones.

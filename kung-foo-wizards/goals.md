Programming can be applied to any area of interest: art & design, music, writing, journalism, civics, science & experimentation, and so on.  The primary goal of this project is to introduce practical computer programming as a means of exploring and enhancing those interests.

It is expected that the project will attract students in varying degrees of depth in programming.  Some students may apply it to a project, some will follow down the rabbit hole.

The project has others goals as well.  One is to provide a basic level of digital literacy to all students at MET West.  An example would be to have all students create their own web page with HTML and CSS.

A third goal is to raise awareness and demand for programming in public education. MET West, like many other schools, does not have even the most basic programming or digital literacy curriculum.  

Another goal is to show the efficacy of allowing students to freely follow their learning compass.  There is a growing list of accounts of success by similar methods.  [Big Picture](http://www.bigpicture.org/) is one of them. See also [SOLE](http://www.ted.com/pages/sole_challenge).  Cite more references in [references](./reference.md).

Another goal is to document and share this process.  That includes methodologies, challenges, and results.  Additionally, this project will produce interactive and instructional open source software, which may be used by other teachers or students.  There is already a good deal of "educational" software developed by this project's leaders, and the open source community. See [Open Source](./open-source.md) for lists and descriptions of applications that are available and/or in-progress.

# Open Market and Community Festival at Perlata Park

Every Saturday or Sunday.  Festival is all day long.  The focus of the event can change throughout the day:  farmers market in the morning, ; general/artisanal market afternoon and evening; entertainment, attractions and prepared foods throughout.  

Featuring the many talented artists, performers, wise people and warriors of our own community.  As a market, the event brings much needed freshness and variety to our hood.  As a festival, it is a place of local commons, where neighbors connect and empower each other.

## Vendors

Ideally, we attract all kinds of vendors:  local businesses; raw foods and goods (a la farmers market); artisanal crafts;  general merchants.  If this is true, we may want to direct which groups go where and when, and what the balance is going to be.  However, it may be best to let nature take it's course and see what happens.

### capacity

What is the comfortable capacity for vendors, leaving room for dance, play, and picnicking?

With the festival lasting all day, we could expect vendors to come and go throughout, some only staying for morning and lunch, others arriving for evening activities. 

### food trucks

In the parking lot.  Space for 4-6 trucks plus tables, chairs, trash cans.  Trucks, like other vendors, may come or go.  Space usage could be separated into morning/afternoon/evening, or by the hour.  Many food trucks use twitter and instagram, we could use those networks to talk to them.   

IDEA: Can we power food trucks electricity off the city grid, instead of them running smoggy generators?  

### fees

Vendors pay $20-40 at First Friday.  With hopes of attracting local vendors and vendors from the city and region, we should probably start at half of that or less.

Trucks might pay more.  TO DO: research food truck rates.

Offer vendors a discount for committing to consecutive weeks.

## On Stage

The stage will give sound and visibility to musicians, dancers, artists, activists, children, and the general public.  It will also highlight our many traditional holidays and diverse celebrations.   

A sound system will be provided, and performers can bring their own.

There is no charge for groups or indivduals to perform.  

Stage acts will consist of:
* featured live performances of all kinds
* open mic
* open jams and dancing

## Attractions and services

The event may provide some free services and activities, to attract more people.  It might be money well spent to pay people to provide these services.   

Examples:
* kids music jam and freakout
* yoga, tai chi, kung fu, dance lessons
* supervised children's activities (movies, games, quiet space)
* WIFI

Idea: kids drums circle and music jam freakout, happens in the lower park, in order to purify that beuatiful area, and validate that it's important to the community and the park staff.

## Promotion & Networking

Fliers, post cards, social networking, website.  Personal visits to other markets.

TO DO:  take pictures of park from top of Peralta House.  

## Donations

What kind of services or goods do we need donated?

* large tent for shade, seating and picnicking 
* sound system equptment (mixers, amps, monitors, and musical instruments)

## Organization

### people

List of all people making decisions and being answerable:
* TO DO

From that list:
* Who are primary contacts for vendors, for performers, for donations and volunteers, for personnel and event coordination?
* Who will direct promotion, graphic designs, sound and stage, market space and general equipment? 

### information

We could use top down park map, or blueprints for the whole property, to accurately map use of space for vendors, and the rest.  

### things we need

* tents for seating and shade
* trash receptacles
* bathroom attendance (or more bathrooms via portables? or they fix the other bathrooms, or open the house up!)
